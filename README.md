# The Humble Dataframe and Modern Data Engineering

Slides and demos for the Western Massachusetts Monthly Full Stack Meetup.

This talk will discuss the role of tabular data (aka dataframes) in modern data pipelines. The focus here is on the engineering of data movement, rather than on the volume of data being moved.

* Define data engineering and modern data pipelines
* Demo three common data pipeline patterns and how tabular data structures can benefit them
* Discuss the limitations of in-memory tabular data structures and list a few options for when it's time to scale (no demos for those--each merits its own talk)
