DISKS ARE SHORT-LIVED AND SURVIVE FOR A FEW MYRS BEFORE BEING DISPERSED  POSSIBLY BY A COMBINATION OF VISCOUS ACCRETION AND PHOTOEVAPORATION BY HIGH ENERGY PHOTONS FROM THE CENTRAL STAR. DISKS EVOLVE ALONG DIVERSE PATHWAYS  THEY MAY OR MAY NOT DEVELOP GAPS OR CENTRAL CAVITIES  MAY GET TRUNCATED OR EXPAND OUT TO LARGE RADII  AND LOSE THEIR MASS ON TIMESCALES THAT VARY WIDELY FROM SOURCE TO SOURCE. HOWEVER  DISK EVOLUTION IS MAINLYPROBED BY DUST  WHICH COMPRISES ONLY 1% OF THE TOTAL MASS. GAS IS THE DOMINANT COMPONENT AND IS PROBED BY WEAK EMISSION LINES EMITTED BY TRACE CHEMICAL SPECIES. GAS DISKS ARE ALSO SHORT-LIVED  BUT GAS EVOLUTION IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT GAS IN PLANET FORMING REGIONS FOR EXTENDED TIME PERIODS IS CRITICAL TO PLANET FORMATION AND DYNAMICS. STUDYING THE GAS COMPONENT OFPROTOPLANETARY DISKS IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING HOW DISKS EVOLVE AND FORM PLANETS. NASA'S SPITZER AND HERSCHEL MISSIONS HAVE RECENTLY DETECTED GAS LINES FROM THE IMPORTANT  1-100 AU  PLANET-FORMING REGIONS OF DISKSIN MANY STAR-FORMING REGIONS  ALLOWING DETAILED STUDIES OF GAS DISK EVOLUTION. THE COMPLEXITY OF DISK STRUCTURE AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE OBSERVED LINES TO PHYSICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS THE STELLAR RADIATION FIELD  AND DISK DENSITY  TEMPERATURE AND CHEMISTRY MAKE THEORETICALMODELS NECESSARY TO INTERPRET THE OBSERVED EMISSION.WE PROPOSE A MULTIWAVELENGTH ANALYSIS OF GASEOUS PROTOPLANETARY DISKS BY MODELING ARCHIVAL SPITZER  ISO AND HERSCHEL INFRARED LINE EMISSION DATA USING OUR GAS DISK THERMO-CHEMICAL MODELS. WE WILL USE ARCHIVAL INFRARED  OPTICAL  UV AND X-RAY DATA  SUPPLEMENTED WITH GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONAL DATA FROM LITERATURE FOR A SAMPLE OF 12 DISKS SPANNING A RANGE OF STELLAR MASSES  DISK CONDITIONS ANDEVOLUTIONARY EPOCHS. A COMPARISON OF THE STELLAR AND DISK PROPERTIES THAT RESULT IN DIFFERING DISK EVOLUTIONARY OUTCOMES WILL REVEAL THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICALPROCESSES THAT DRIVE DISK EVOLUTION AND DETERMINE THE PLANET FORMING POTENTIAL OF DISKS. FROM OUR STUDY OF A VARIED SAMPLE OF DISKS AND FROM A CAREFUL CHARACTERIZATION OF THEIR DUST AND GAS CONTENT  WE WILL ESTABLISH DISK MASSES AND SURFACE DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS  INFERTHE PROCESSES THAT AFFECT SURFACE DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS (E.G.  HOLES AND OUTER RADIUS)  AND ESTIMATE PHOTOEVAPORATION RATES AND DISK LIFETIMES.

ON MARS  THIS EFFORT HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE SUCCESSFUL SEARCH FOR WATER AND HABITABILITY. THE NEXT STEP WILL BE SEARCHING SPECIFIC LOCATIONS FOR SIGNS OF PAST LIFE. ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING PLACES ARE THE HYDROTHERMAL SINTER DEPOSITS IN THE NILI PATERA CALDERA OF THE SYRTIS MAJOR VOLCANO. THESE DEPOSITS WOULD HAVE BEEN LONG-LIVED  WITH THE SUITABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND PROVIDE A WELL-MAPPED FEATURE FOR A TARGETED MISSION.  TO PREPARE FOR THIS TYPE OF MISSION  WE PROPOSE A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS AND FIELD OPERATIONS TO DEVELOP THE REQUIRED METHODOLOGIES.  OPERATING AT AN EXTINCT HOT SPRING DEPOSIT IN A MARTIAN ANALOG AND EXTREME LIFE ENVIRONMENT IN ICELAND  WE WILL COLLECT SAMPLES AND IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS TO DETERMINE THE RESOLUTIONS AND DATA SETS REQUIRED TO ANSWER THE KEY MISSION OBJECTIVES. WE WILL ALSO TEST TRAFFICABILITY TO DETERMINE THE SPACECRAFT CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR MISSION SUCCESS.  THE PROPOSED ADVANCEMENTS BREAK DOWN INTO THE CATEGORIES OF SCIENCE  SCIENCE OPERATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY. SCIENCE OBJECTIVES WILL FOCUS BUILDING ON THE EXTENSIVE SET OF TERRESTRIAL LITERATURE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO THIS MISSION. FOR EXAMPLE  HOW DO WE IDENTIFY ALL POTENTIAL SIGNS OF LIFE PRESERVED IN THE SINTERS AND HOW TO SINTERS RECORD SIGNS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND VOLCANIC PROPERTIES. SPECIFIC TO THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SPACECRAFT INSTRUMENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. SCIENCE OPERATIONS WILL FOCUS ON THE SUITE OF INSTRUMENTS NEEDED TO OPERATE TOGETHER TO ANSWER THE MISSION GOALS AND WHAT TYPE OF SAMPLES AND MOBILITY WILL BE REQUIRED FOR SUCCESS. THE TECHNOLOGY SECTION WILL BE TO DEVELOP THE METHODS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS DETERMINED BY THE SCIENCE EFFORT.  THIS INCLUDES SAMPLE COLLECTION AND HANDLING METHODOLOGY AND DETERMINING A PLAN TO DEVELOP CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FIELD INSTRUMENTS INTOPLANETARY CAPABLE VERSIONS.METHODOLOGY:DR. SKOK WILL LEAD A DIVERSE TEAM OF HYDROTHERMAL  BIOLOGICAL AND INSTRUMENTAL EXPERTS TO STUDY A COMPARABLE HOT SPRING DEPOSIT IN ICELAND TO EXAMINE ALL THE POTENTIAL MISSION ISSUES AND SCENARIOS  ALONG WITH SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS. A COMBINATION OF LAB ANALYSIS OF COLLECTED SAMPLES AND IN-SITU DEPLOYMENT OF FIELD INSTRUMENTS WILL BE USED TO PREPARE FOR THIS FUTURE MISSION.RELEVANCE TO PLANETARY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THROUGH ANALOG RESEARCH:THIS PROPOSAL MEETS THE STATED PSTAR GOAL OF FUNDING PROJECTS TO PLANETARY ANALOG SITES TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODOLOGIES REQUIRED FOR FUTURE MISSIONS  ESPECIALLY TO EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS.

DISCOVERY OF VOLATILE ORGANICS AND PERHAPS LIFE ON MARS IS UNLIKELY WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ACCESS TO THE SUBSURFACE. MANY OF THE GOALS OF NASA'S PLANETARY SCIENCE PROGRAM REQUIRE MOBILE SURVEYS SAMPLING DRY OR ICE-BEARING REGOLITH OR BEDROCK AND SAMPLE TRANSFER TO INSTRUMENTS. SEVERAL FUTURE PLANETARY EXPLORATION MISSIONS CALL FOR THIS INCLUDING THE PROPOSED EXOMARS ROVER IN 2018. LIGHT SPEED DELAYS FOR MARS MISSIONS (TENS OF MINUTES) ARE MUCH LONGER THAN THE TIME REQUIRED (SECONDS) TO GET A DRILL STUCK  SO DEEP SPACE ROVER DRILLING OPERATIONS MUST BE AUTOMATED AND FAIL-SAFE  OR ELSE RISK ANCHORING THE ROVER. OBTAINING SUBSURFACE SAMPLES OF REGOLITH WILL REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY A SUITABLE LOCATION  TRANSPORT AND EMPLACE A DRILLING APPARATUS  AND CONTROL THE OPERATION WITH HIGH RELIABILITY.WE PROPOSE A MARS ROVER ANALOG MISSION AS A HIGH FIDELITY FIELD TEST OF AN INTEGRATED ROVER-DRILL SYSTEM WITH PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE THEMSELVES FLIGHT MISSION CANDIDATES. DEPTH AND SAMPLE VOLUME REQUIREMENTS FOR SCIENTIFIC SAMPLE ACQUISITION IMPOSE THE NEED FOR A DRILL CAPABLE OF PENETRATING DEPTHS OF A METER OR GREATER. OBSERVING THE OPERATION OF THE ROVER/DRILLING SYSTEM IN A HIGH FIDELITY ENVIRONMENT ILLUMINATE THE DIFFICULT ISSUES OF LOW-GRAVITY DRILLING INTO AN UNKNOWN SUBSTRATE  DRILL SITE SENSING AND SELECTION  AND DRILL SYSTEM EMPLACEMENT AND STABILIZATION.THE EXISTING ICEBREAKER-3 ROTARY-PERCUSSIVE DRILL SYSTEM (DERIVED ITSELF FROM THE PRIOR LIFE IN THE ATACAMA (LITA) ASTEP DRILL)  AND A NEW AUTONOMOUS MID-SIZED ROVER CONCEPT DEVELOPED BY NASA-AMES (DEVELOPED WITH SUPPORT FROM NASA EXPLORATION SYSTEMS)  ARE AVAILABLE AND COMPATIBLE FOR THE INTEGRATION REQUIRED FOR AN ANALOG SITE FIELD EXPERIMENT.   THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS TO THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENT ARE: 1) USE OF INTEGRATED DRILL AND ROVER AT SITES IN THE ATACAMA DESERT IN CHILE IN UNPREPARED ""REGOLITH""; 2) FIELD USE OF INSTRUMENTS WITH THE ROVER/DRILL THAT ARE FLIGHT PROTOTYPES COMPARABLE TO THOSE PLANNED FOR EXOMARS; 3) ACQUIRE DRILLED CUTTINGS AND TRANSFER TO INSTRUMENTS; 4) ON-BOARD AUTONOMY AND MONITORING TO SUPPORT DRILLING; FLIGHT-LIKE MISSION AND SCIENCE SUPPORT (OPERATIONS AND CONTROL) FOR THE ROVER/DRILL/INSTRUMENT OPERATIONS.  THE MOTIVATING GOAL BEHIND THE MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM IS THE SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE OF LIFE (E.G. MEPAG  DECADAL SURVEY  ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP). THE COLD AND DRY CONDITIONS ON MARS OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT EVIDENCE FOR LIFE MAY BE WELL PRESERVED IN THE FORM OF ORGANIC BIOMARKERS. EVEN WITHOUT BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTION  ORGANICS SHOULD STILL BE PRESENT ON MARS DUE TO THE FLUX OF ORGANIC BEARING METEORITIC MATERIAL (BENNER ET AL.  2000).  THREE MISSIONS HAVE TRIED TO DETECT ORGANICS ON MARS: MSL  THE PYROLYSIS GCMS ON VIKING (BIEMAN ET AL. 1979) AND THE TEGA ON PHOENIX (BOYNTON ET AL. 2009). IN ALL PRIOR INSTANCES THE SOIL SAMPLES WERE HEATED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES TO CAUSE VAPORIZATION OF ORGANICS ALLOWING DETECTION. THE PHOENIX DISCOVERY OF PERCHLORATES IN THE SOIL (HECHT ET AL. 2009) SUGGESTS STRONG OXIDANTS INCLUDING PERCHLORATE CAUSED ORGANIC OXIDATION TO CO2 PRIOR TO DETECTION. A REANALYSIS OF VIKING RESULTS (NAVARRO-GONZALEZ ET AL.  2010) SUGGEST THAT ~0.1% PERCHLORATES AND A FEW PPM OF ORGANICS WERE PRESENT AT THE VIKING LANDING SITES.IN SUMMARY  GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF PERCHLORATE IN THE SURFACE SOIL  AND THE CHEMICAL REACTIVITY OF THE UPPER SOIL LAYERS  METHODS ARE NEEDED THAT CAN DETECT ORGANIC MATERIALS IN SAMPLES COLLECTED BELOW THE ZONE OF ACTIVE OXIDATION (BULLOCK ET AL. 2004)  AT THE SUBPPM LEVEL AND IN THE PRESENCE OF PERCHLORATE. THE PROPOSED ARADS ROVER/DRILL COMBINATION  OPERATING ON THE PERCHLORATE-BEARING DESICCATED SOILS OF THE ATACAMA ANALOG SITE  WILL PROVIDE HIGH-FIDELITY SAMPLE COLLECTION AND SCIENCE OPPORTUNITIES TO TEST THESE DETECTION METHODS.",NON,12,B,2,,2017-03-20 00:00:00

THE PROJECT WILL INVOLVE NUMERICAL MODELLING AND COMPARISON OF THE RESULTS WITH OBSERVATIONS OF PLANETS BY RADIAL VELOCITIES  TRANSITS  AND DIRECT DETECTIONS.  THE CALCULATIONS WILL BE BASED ON GIANT AND SUB-NEPTUNE PLANET FORMATION THROUGH THE CORE-NUCLEATED ACCRETION MODEL (CNA)  IN WHICH A HEAVY-ELEMENT CORE FORMS FIRST.  ONCE IT HAS ATTAINED SUFFICIENT MASS  IT CAPTURES GAS FROM THE PROTOPLANETARY DISK AS IT CONTINUES TO ACCRETE SOLIDS.  SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PHYSICS  COMPARED WITH PAST WORK  WILL BE INCORPORATED. SPECIFICALLY  WE WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT IS THE FORMATION HISTORY OF A NEPTUNE-TYPE PLANET FORMED IN THE INNER DISK  WITHIN 2 AU OF ITS STAR  AS A FUNCTION OF POSITION OF THE PLANET IN THE DISK AND THE DISK PROPERTIES? (2) CAN THE SUB-NEPTUNE PLANETS  TO DATE OBSERVED PRIMARILY WITHIN 1 AU FROM THEIR STAR  BE BEST EXPLAINED THROUGH FORMATION AT GREATER DISTANCES FOLLOWED BY ORBITAL MIGRATION  OR BY IN SITU FORMATION? (3) IS THE OBSERVED MASS-RADIUS RELATION  FOR THE NEPTUNE-SIZE PLANETS FOR WHICH BOTH HAVE BEEN OBSERVED  CONSISTENT WITH FORMATION BY CNA? (4) CAN THE OBSERVED PROPERTIES  SUCH AS LUMINOSITIES AND EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURES  OF DIRECTLY-DETECTED EXTRASOLAR PLANETS BE EXPLAINED BY CNA MODELS? TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS  A NUMBER OF STATE-OF-THE- ART CODES WILL BE EMPLOYED TO MODEL IN DETAIL DIFFERENT PROCESSES AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THE PLANET S GROWTH.  A MULTI-ZONE ACCRETION CODE WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE THE MODEL FOR ACCRETION OF PLANETESIMALS ONTO THE PLANET.  A PLANET FORMATION CODE THAT INCLUDES A LARGE NUMBER OF PHYSICAL EFFECTS WILL BE USED TO MODEL THE PLANET EVOLUTION UNTIL GAS ACCRETION ENDS.  A 3-D HIGH-RESOLUTION RADIATION-HYDRODYNAMICS CODE  WHICH CALCULATES GAS ACCRETION RATES ONTO A PLANET EMBEDDED IN AND INTERACTING WITH A DISK  WILL PROVIDE GAS ACCRETION RATES DURING RUNAWAY GAS GROWTH.,NON,12,B,2,,2017-05-05 00:00:00

PROJECT SUMMARY: THE SETI INSTITUTE (SI) TEAM PROPOSES A RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT WILL DEVELOP A ROADMAP TO BIOSIGNATURE EXPLORATION IN SUPPORT OF NASA'S DECADAL PLAN FOR THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS.  THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY FOR NASA TO SEARCH FOR ANCIENT TRACES OF LIFE ON MARS WILL BE 2020  WHEN A CURIOSITY-CLASS ROVER IS EXPECTED TO EXPLORE ANCIENT HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS AND CACHE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SAMPLES.  CACHING SAMPLES IS HIGH-COST AND HIGH RISK  AND THE SINGLE MOST COMPELLING QUESTION TO ASK IN SUPPORT OF SUCH A MISSION IS: HOW DO WE IDENTIFY AND CACHE THE MOST VALUABLE SAMPLES?  THE SI MAKES THIS QUESTION THE INTELLECTUAL FOCUS OF IT RESEARCH PROGRAM.  FOUR RESEARCH AREAS STUDY THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THIS CENTRAL QUESTION.  WITHIN THEM FOCUS AREAS REGROUP INVESTIGATIONS THAT SYNERGISTICALLY TACKLE KEY ASPECTS OF EARLY MARS HABITABILITY  TAPHONOMIC WINDOWS AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL  THEIR PRESERVATION POTENTIAL  AND THEIR DETECTABILITY.  RESEARCH IS PERFORMED THROUGH AN INTEGRATED EXPLORATION OF EVER-INCREASING RESOLUTION THAT CORRELATES MEASUREMENT FROM MEGASCALE TO MOLECULAR SCALE  AND ENVISIONS EACH ESSENTIAL COMPONENT THROUGH THE UNIQUE PRISM OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING EARLY MARTIAN ENVIRONMENT.  ULTIMATELY  IT PRODUCES GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE TO RESEARCH  WHAT TO SEARCH FOR  AND HOW TO SEARCH.THE RESEARCH PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THE SI TEAM IS TIMELY  NEEDED  AND WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT A DECADE OF SEARCHES FOR LIFE ON MARS THAT MAY CULMINATE WITH A MARS SAMPLE RETURN MISSION.SCIENTIFICALLY  WE WILL CHARACTERIZE TERRESTRIAL ANALOGS TO ENVIRONMENTS AND BIOGEOMATERIALS CONSIDERED OF HIGH-PRIORITY TO THE SEARCH FOR TRACES OF ANCIENT LIFE ON MARS  AND WILL INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGING EARLY MARS CONDITIONS ON THE PRESERVATION OF BIOSIGNATURES.

DUE TO THEIR UBIQUITY IN SPACE  PAHS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PRESENT IN DENSE MOLECULAR CLOUDS WHERE THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE FROZEN OUT IN H2O RICH ICES. UNDER THE EFFECT OF THE ATTENUATED UV RADIATION IN THE CLOUDS  PAHS WILL REACT WITH THE H2O ICE TO PRODUCE BIOGENICALLY IMPORTANT OXYGEN CONTAINING PAHS. THESE PREBIOTIC  COMPLEX SPECIES COULD BE LATER INCORPORATED INTO COMETS AND METEORITES AND DELIVERED TO HABITABLE PLANETS  SUCH AS THE PRIMORDIAL EARTH. SINCE OXYGENATED PAHS  SUCH AS QUINONES AND AROMATIC ALCOHOLS  PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN BIOCHEMISTRY  UNDERSTANDING THEIR EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGINS  FORMATION MECHANISM  AND DISTRIBUTION IS RELEVANT TO ASTROBIOLOGY. ASTRONOMICALLY  THE DETECTION OF SPECIFIC PAHS IN H2O ICES IS CRITICAL IN UNDERSTANDING THEIR PHOTOCHEMISTRY IN DENSE CLOUDS. HERE WE PROPOSE A TWO PRONGED APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE ASTRONOMICAL PAHS PLAY IN PREBIOTIC ASTROCHEMISTRY. ONE COMPRISES A COMPREHENSIVE THEORETICAL STUDY IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN ONGOING EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM OF THE REACTIONS AND SPECTROSCOPY OF PAHS IN H2O ICES WITH THE GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING THE STEPWISE FORMATION OF COMPLEX PREBIOTIC SUBSTITUTED PAHS IN DENSE CLOUDS. SECONDLY  WE PROPOSE TO EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURE IR SPECTROSCOPIC SIGNATURES OF PAHS  PAH IONS AND OTHER PHOTOPRODUCTS IN H2O ICE AND APPLY THESE TO INTERPRET SPITZER OBSERVATIONS OF DENSE CLOUDS FOCUSING ON THE YOUNG STELLAR OBJECT YSO SPECTRA SINCE THE DENSE CLOUD MATERIAL ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ENVIRONMENTS MORE CLOSELY REFLECTS THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS DURING THE FORMATION OF OUR SUN.,NON,12,B,2,,2017-05-05 00:00:00

THE UNIFYING INTELLECTUAL FOCUS OF THE VIRTUAL PLANETARY LABORATORY IS TO LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE WHETHER AN EXTRASOLAR PLANET CAN OR DOES SUPPORT LIFE. ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WORK TOWARDS THAT SPECIFIC GOAL. TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL  WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE TEAM AND MODELING TOOLBOX REQUIRED TO ANALYZE PLANETARY HABITABILITY AS A MULTI DIMENSIONAL  INTERDISCIPLINARY PARAMETER SPACE. WE WILL USE THIS IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE OF PLANETARY HABITABILITY TO DETERMINE THE PLANETARY CHARACTERISTICS  AND THE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES REQUIRED TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN PLANETS WITH AND WITHOUT LIFE. THIS RESEARCH SUPPORTS NASA ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP GOALS 1  4  5 AND 7. THE VPL WILL EXPLORE THE EVOLUTION AND LIMITS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANET HABITABILITY VIA A PLANETS INTERACTION WITH ITS PARENT STAR AND PLANETARY SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT  AND IDENTIFY LIFES OBSERVABLE IMPACT ON A PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT FOR DIFFERENT METABOLISMS  PLANETARY COMPOSITIONS  AND HOST STARS.

THE KEY PRODUCT TO BE DELIVERED TO THE PDS WILL BE A COMPLETE INSTRUMENT POINTING RECONSTRUCTION WITH PRECISION SUITABLE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF MOST NARROW-ANGLE IMAGES. IN ADDITION  WE WILL DELIVER A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF ""BACKPLANES "" WHICH DESCRIBE THE GEOMETRIC CONTENT OF EACH SAMPLE WITHIN EACH DATA PRODUCT FROM THE REMOTE SENSING INSTRUMENTS. THIS WILL ENABLE MOST SCIENTISTS TO FOCUS ON THEIR RESEARCH RATHER THAN ON SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIALLY TEDIOUS DATA ANALYSIS STEPS. THIS PROJECT THEREFORE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO OPEN UP THE CASSINI DATA SETS TO MUCH BROADER PARTICIPATION AND ALSO TO REDUCE THE OVERALL COST OF CASSINI DATA ANALYSIS TO NASA. THIS EFFORT WILL BUILD UPON NEW SOFTWARE DEVELOPED AT THE PDS RINGS NODE  AND ALREADY IN USE FOR ""OPUS"" (HTTP://PDS-RINGS.SETI.ORG/SEARCH)  THE GEOMETRIC SEARCH ENGINE FUNDED BY PDS AND THE CASSINI PROJECT. INITIAL TESTS DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS AMBITIOUS GOAL. KEY TASKS SUPPORTED BY THIS PROJECT WILL BE TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL WAYS TO DETERMINE ROBUST POINTING CORRECTIONS  AND TO AUTOMATE THE ENTIRE PROCEDURE. EXTENSIVE QUALITY-CONTROL TESTS AND A PEER REVIEW WILL BE PERFORMED TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THE FINAL PRODUCTS. WE WILL DELIVER AN INITIAL SET OF PRODUCTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE  SO THAT USERS CAN BENEFIT FROM OUR WORK AND SO THAT THEIR FEEDBACK CAN ENABLE US TO MAKE FURTHER REFINEMENTS.

MARK MARLEY. THE PI FOR THIS PROPOSAL  DR. RICHARD FREEDMAN  IS A CO-I ON THESE PROPOSALS.ABSTRACT FOR NNH11ZDA001N 11-OSS11-0134:THE NEXT FEW YEARS ARE EXPECTED TO WITNESS THE DISCOVERY OF A MULTITUDE OF YOUNG  WARMGIANT PLANETS BY SEVERAL DIRECT IMAGING GROUNDBASED SURVEYS. THESE DISCOVERIES WILL BEFOLLOWED UP BY HST AND JWST OBSERVATIONS OF THESE YOUNG WORLDS. WE PROPOSE TOCONSTRUCT THEORETICAL MODELS OF THE EVOLUTION AND THERMAL EMISSION SPECTRA OF YOUNGPLANETS OPTIMIZED TO MATCH THE PHOTOMETRIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC DATA THAT WILL SOON BEAVAILABLE. IN PARTICULAR WE WILL EXPLORE LARGER RANGES OF PARAMETER SPACE  INCLUDINGCOMPOSITION AND CLOUD PROPERTIES  THAN HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXPLORED TO STUDY YOUNGPLANETS. WE EXPECT THIS WORK WILL BE IMMEDIATELY USEFUL FOR INTERPRETING DATA FROM HST SPHERE AND GPI AND WILL ALSO ULTIMATELY BE VALUABLE FOR UNDERSTANDING JWST DATA.ABSTRACT FOR NH11ZDA001N 11-PATM11-0014:THE PAST HALF DECADE HAS BEEN THE ERA OF THE TRANSITING PLANETS. WE EXPECT THE NEXT HALFDOZEN YEARS WILL BE THE ERA OF THE DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS. UNLIKE THE CASE OF THE TRANSITING PLANETS  THE DETECTION OF YOUNG GAS AND ICE GIANTS DETECTED IN THERMAL EMISSION OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASUREMENT OF SPECTRA AND THUS OFFERS FAR MORE ROBUST OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDIES OF EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES. WE THUS PROPOSE A SUITE OF INVESTIGATIONS FOCUSING ON CLOUDS IN DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS. SPECIFICALLY WE WILL STUDY DISEQUILIBRIUM PROCESSES AFFECTING SILICATE CLOUDS  THE ROLE OF RELATIVELY MINOR CLOUDS IN SCULPTING SPECTRA AT LOW GRAVITY  THE ROLE OF WATER ICE CLOUDS  AND A GENERAL INVESTIGATION OF THE SPECTRA OF A GREAT VARIETY OF PLANETS WITH VARYING ATMOSPHERIC METALLICITY AND C/O RATIO. THIS WORK WILL SUPPORT INTERPRETATION OF THE ALREADY KNOWN DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS AND--MORE IMPORTANTLY--THE WEALTH OF DATA WE EXPECT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE WILL COMPARE OUR MODEL PREDICTIONS TO DATA IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND RELATE THEM TO THOSE PROCESSES ACTING IN SOLAR SYSTEM ATMOSPHERES,NON,12,B,2,,2017-06-05 00:00:00

OBTAINING SUBSURFACE SAMPLES OF REGOLITH WILL REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY A SUITABLE LOCATION  TRANSPORT AND EMPLACE A DRILLING APPARATUS  AND CONTROL THE OPERATION WITH HIGH RELIABILITY.WE PROPOSE A MARS ROVER ANALOG MISSION AS A FIELD TEST OF AN INTEGRATED ROVER-DRILL SYSTEM WITH PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE FLIGHT MISSION CANDIDATES. DEPTH AND SAMPLE VOLUME REQUIREMENTS FOR SCIENTIFIC SAMPLE ACQUISITION IMPOSE THE NEED FOR A DRILL CAPABLE OF PENETRATING DEPTHS OF A METER OR GREATER.

GIVEN THE LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR PERVASIVE PLATE TECTONICS  THE ANCIENT MARTIAN CRUST IS LIKELY TO BE PRESERVED AT DEPTH  IN CONTRAST TO THEEARTH WHERE CRUSTAL RECYCLING HAS DESTROYED MOST OF THE EARLY GEOLOGIC RECORD. ALTHOUGH THE SURFACE OF MARS IS RELATIVELY OLD  KNOWN EXPOSURE OF DEEP CRUSTAL MATERIAL ARE LIMITED. THE MAIN MECHANISM FOR EXPOSING DEEP CRUSTAL MATERIAL IS IMPACT CRATERING. WE PROPOSE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS NATURAL EXPOSURE  AND USE HYPERSPECTRAL OBSERVATIONS OF THE CRATER CENTRAL PEAKS TO IDENTIFY THE COMPOSITIONAL PROPERTIES OF THIS ANCIENT MARTIAN CRUST.THIS PROPOSED CENTRAL PEAK SURVEY WILL BE DRIVEN BY COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM)OBSERVATIONS THAT OFFER RESOLUTION OF UP TO 18M/PIXEL  AND WILL BE THE FIRST GLOBAL EFFORT TO MAP INDIVIDUAL MAFIC UNITS  AS OPPOSED TO AGGREGATED SURFACE UNITS  WITHIN THE CENTRAL PEAKS  AND TO INTEGRATE LOCAL  REGIONAL AND GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS. OTHER COMPOSITIONAL DATASETS  PARTICULARLY THE THERMAL EMISSION IMAGING SYSTEM (THEMIS) WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CHARACTERIZATION FOR THE EXAMPLES WITHLARGE ENOUGH DEPOSITS. FOR EACH OF OUR TARGET SITES  WE WILL CONDUCT A DETAILED LOCAL AND REGIONAL MAPPING EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT EVENTS THAT ACTED ON AND MODIFIED THE MATERIAL EXPOSED BY THE LATEST IMPACT EVENT. FROM THIS  WE WILL CONSTRAIN THE DEPTH OF EXCAVATION OF THE MATERIAL WITH THE INTENTION OF DEVELOPING A COMPOSITIONAL STRATIGRAPHY FOR EARLY MARS. WITH THIS COMPOSITIONAL AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION ON THE ANCIENT CRUST  WE WILL TEST THEORIES FOR THE DIFFERENTIATION OF MARS AND CREATE A MODEL FOR FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE PRE-NOACHIAN CRUST.

MARK MARLEY. THE PI FOR THIS PROPOSAL  DR. RICHARD FREEDMAN  IS A CO-I ON THESE PROPOSALS.ABSTRACT FOR NNH11ZDA001N 11-OSS11-0134:THE NEXT FEW YEARS ARE EXPECTED TO WITNESS THE DISCOVERY OF A MULTITUDE OF YOUNG  WARMGIANT PLANETS BY SEVERAL DIRECT IMAGING GROUNDBASED SURVEYS. THESE DISCOVERIES WILL BEFOLLOWED UP BY HST AND JWST OBSERVATIONS OF THESE YOUNG WORLDS. WE PROPOSE TOCONSTRUCT THEORETICAL MODELS OF THE EVOLUTION AND THERMAL EMISSION SPECTRA OF YOUNGPLANETS OPTIMIZED TO MATCH THE PHOTOMETRIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC DATA THAT WILL SOON BEAVAILABLE. IN PARTICULAR WE WILL EXPLORE LARGER RANGES OF PARAMETER SPACE  INCLUDINGCOMPOSITION AND CLOUD PROPERTIES  THAN HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXPLORED TO STUDY YOUNGPLANETS. WE EXPECT THIS WORK WILL BE IMMEDIATELY USEFUL FOR INTERPRETING DATA FROM HST SPHERE AND GPI AND WILL ALSO ULTIMATELY BE VALUABLE FOR UNDERSTANDING JWST DATA.ABSTRACT FOR NH11ZDA001N 11-PATM11-0014:THE PAST HALF DECADE HAS BEEN THE ERA OF THE TRANSITING PLANETS. WE EXPECT THE NEXT HALFDOZEN YEARS WILL BE THE ERA OF THE DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS. UNLIKE THE CASE OF THE TRANSITING PLANETS  THE DETECTION OF YOUNG GAS AND ICE GIANTS DETECTED IN THERMAL EMISSION OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASUREMENT OF SPECTRA AND THUS OFFERS FAR MORE ROBUST OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDIES OF EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES. WE THUS PROPOSE A SUITE OF INVESTIGATIONS FOCUSING ON CLOUDS IN DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS. SPECIFICALLY WE WILL STUDY DISEQUILIBRIUM PROCESSES AFFECTING SILICATE CLOUDS  THE ROLE OF RELATIVELY MINOR CLOUDS IN SCULPTING SPECTRA AT LOW GRAVITY  THE ROLE OF WATER ICE CLOUDS  AND A GENERAL INVESTIGATION OF THE SPECTRA OF A GREAT VARIETY OF PLANETS WITH VARYING ATMOSPHERIC METALLICITY AND C/O RATIO. THIS WORK WILL SUPPORT INTERPRETATION OF THE ALREADY KNOWN DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS AND--MORE IMPORTANTLY--THE WEALTH OF DATA WE EXPECT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

WE PROPOSE TO SUPPLY THE ASTRONOMICAL COMMUNITY WITH THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL SPECTRA OF A WIDE RANGE OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS PAHS AND PAH CLUSTERS AND TO USE OUR IR ABSORPTION SPECTRA TO CALCULATE EMISSION SPECTRA THAT WILL BE CRUCIAL IN INTERPRETING THE NEW OBSERVATIONAL DATA.THE INFRARED SPACE OBSERVATORY AND SPITZER SPACE TELESCOPES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MID IR EMISSION SPECTRUM OF THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM IS DOMINATED BY STRONG BANDS AT  MICRONS SUPERIMPOSED UPON BROAD UNDERLYING PLATEAUS GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO PAHS  PAH CLUSTERS AND VERY SMALL GRAINS. DESPITE THE LIMITED SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THESE DATA  DETAILED ANALYSIS HAS REVEALED THAT EACH BAND IS  IN FACT  A BLEND OF MULTIPLE EMISSION FEATURES. SUBTLE VARIATIONS IN THE BAND BLENDING CAN BE DETECTED EVEN FOR SPECTRA MEASURED AT DIFFERENT POSITIONS WITHIN A SINGLE ASTRONOMICAL SOURCE. THESE VARIATIONS CAN BE SEEN TO ARISE FROM MULTIPLE PAH AND PAH RELATED CARRIERS THAT ARE EACH RESPONDING DIFFERENTLY TO THE LOCAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE HAS NEAR IR AND MID IR INSTRUMENTS  NIRSPEC AND MIRI  WITH AN EXTREMELY HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION  SPATIAL RESOLUTION  AND SENSITIVITY THAT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE INFRARED ASTRONOMY. THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL PROVIDE SPATIAL MAPS ON A SUB ARCSECOND SCALE WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF SPECTRAL DETAIL  ALLOWING DETAILED STUDY OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS WITHIN EACH EMISSION BAND. THIS WILL PROVIDE A CRITICAL INSIGHT INTO THE MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EMITTING SPECIES AND THEIR  PHOTOCHEMICAL EVOLUTION IN SPACE.EXPLOITATION OF THESE ASTRONOMICAL SPECTRA REQUIRES FUNDAMENTAL DATA ON POTENTIAL EMITTING SPECIES THAT FULLY ACCOUNT FOR ALL ASTROPHYSICALLY RELEVANT MATERIALS. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES  SPECTRA OF NEUTRAL AND CHARGED PAHS HAVE BEEN CALCULATED USING QUANTUM THEORY. DUE TO COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS  THIS DATA SET IS BIASED TOWARDS SMALLER OR HIGHLY SYMMETRIC SPECIES. IN ADDITION  CONTINUED ANALYSIS OF THE MID IR EMISSION BANDS BY SEVERAL RECENT SPITZER STUDIES  HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT PAHS AND PAH CLUSTERSWITH LESS SYMMETRIC STRUCTURES CONTAINING BAY REGIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE IR EMISSION BANDS THAN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN REALIZED. THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFRARED DATA SET ON LESS SYMMETRIC PAHS AND PAH CLUSTERS IS INSUFFICIENT TO EXPLOIT THE ASTRONOMICAL DATA.ADVANCES IN COMPUTING POWER NOW ALLOW SPECTRA FOR A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF SPECIES TO BE CALCULATED. IN SUPPORT OF THE ANALYSIS OF SPITZER DATA AND THE UPCOMING JWST MISSION  WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO CALCULATE THE 3 20 MICRON SPECTRA OF ISOLATED AS WELL AS CLUSTERED NEUTRAL AND CHARGED PAHS CONTAINING UP TO 150 CARBON ATOMS AND WITH A WIDE RANGE OF COMPACT STRUCTURES AND ERODED STRUCTURES WITH IRREGULAR SHAPES CONTAINING BAY REGIONS  COVES  AND FJORDS.

AT THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE ON THE ICY SATURN SATELLITES  ~80 K  AMORPHOUS ICE IS STABLE AGAINST THERMAL RECRYSTALLIZATION FOR LONG TIMESCALES (MASTRAPA ET AL. 2013)  BUT SURFACES ARE GENERALLY OBSERVED TO BE CRYSTALLINE. HOWEVER  SMALL AMOUNTS OF CRYSTALLINE ICE CAN DOMINATE THE INFRARED SPECTRUM (MASTRAPA ET AL. 2009). TEMPERATURE MAPS OF THE SATELLITES SHOW ANOMALOUS AND UNEXPECTED DISTRIBUTIONS ON TWO OF THE THREE SATELLITES (HOWETT ET AL 2011  2012  2013 AND REFERENCES THEREIN) ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN THERMAL INERTIA DUE TO THE HIGH ENERGY ELECTRON BOMBARDMENT AFFECTING THE SURFACES. COLOR MAPS OF MIMAS AND TETHYS ALSO SHOW PATTERNS (SCHENK ET AL. 2011) THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ICE AND THE VERY HIGH-ENERGY ELECTRONS. A STUDY OF THE PHASE OF THE ICE WOULD FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE EFFECT OF ELECTRON BOMBARDMENT ON ICY SURFACES IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS DIFFICULT TO REPRODUCE IN THE LABORATORY  YIELDING INFORMATION ON THE PHYSICS OF THE ICE. SCIENCE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: OUR GOAL IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICS AFFECTING THE SURFACES OF THREE ICY SATURN SATELLITES AND TO DEEPEN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHASE-CHANGE PROCESSES. IN FACT  SINCE THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SURFACE AND OF THE RADIATION FIELD IMPINGING ON IT ARE MOSTLY KNOWN (E.G.  HOWETT ET AL. 2012  COOPER ET AL. 2010) THE SURFACE OF THESE SATELLITES REPRESENT A NATURAL LABORATORY TO TEST AND IMPROVE OUR KNOWLEDGE. WE HAVE CHOSEN MIMAS  TETHYS  AND DIONE BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION WITH RESPECT TO SATURN'S MAGNETOSPHERE AND THEREFORE THEIR DIFFERENT DEGREES OF EXPOSURE TO HIGH-ENERGY ELECTRONS FROM EXTREME TO MILD RESPECTIVELY. METHODOLOGY: WHILE THE USUAL DISCRIMINATOR FOR AMORPHOUS VERSUS CRYSTALLINE H2O ICE IS THE 1.65- M BAND  THE VIMS DATA IN THIS SPECTRAL REGION ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INSTRUMENTAL EFFECT. ACCORDINGLY  WE HAVE DEVELOPED A TECHNIQUE TO DETECT SMALL AMOUNTS OF AMORPHOUS ICE BASED ON THE SHAPE OF THE 2 M BAND AS IT VARIES WITH PHASE CHANGES (DALLE ORE ET AL 2015). THE PURPOSE OF THE ANALYSIS IS TO MAP AREAS WHERE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE AND RADIATION WOULD ALLOW THE PRESENCE OF AMORPHOUS ICE. WE WILL ALSO INCLUDE MAPPING OF THE FRESNEL PEAK POSITION AND STRENGTH (ACCOUNTING FOR PHASE-ANGLE EFFECTS)  THEREFORE SAMPLING DIFFERENT DEPTHS. THIS WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE PROCESSES AT WORK AS WELL AS THE EFFICIENCY OF AMORPHIZATION AS A FUNCTION OF DEPTH  YIELDING THE PENETRATION DEPTH OF RADIATION. WHERE POSSIBLE  WE WILL ANALYZE MULTIPLE OBSERVATIONS OF THE SAME TERRAIN OBSERVED AT DIFFERENT TIMES TO INVESTIGATE TEMPORAL VARIATIONS. RELEVANCE TO CDAPS AND SOLSTICE MISSION: THE ANALYSIS OF THE ICE PHASE VARIATIONS ON MIMAS WILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS ONE OF THE NEW TOP PRIORITY QUESTIONS OF THE SOLSTICE MISSION  I.E. TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS BEHIND ITS UNIQUE THERMAL PROPERTIES DISCOVERED BY CASSINI IN THE XM. FURTHERMORE  THE ANALYSIS OF MIMAS  DIONE  AND TETHYS WILL ADD TO THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SATURN'S MID-SIZED SATELLITES  THEIR GEOLOGICAL AND CRATERING HISTORIES  AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE SATURN SYSTEM  ANOTHER TOP PRIORITY QUESTION OF THE SOLSTICE MISSION. THIS STUDY WILL SHED LIGHT ON: A) THE FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF H2O ICE IN OUR PLANETARY SYSTEM; B) SOME OF THE PHYSICAL  AND DYNAMICAL PROCESSES THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE SATELLITES CLOSER TO SATURN. THEREFORE  THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION ENHANCE THE SCIENTIFIC RETURN OF THE CASSINI MISSION BY BROADENING THE SCIENTIFIC PARTICIPATION IN THE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA RETURNED BY THE MISSION  THE MAIN GOAL OF THE CDAPS PROGRAM.,NON,M,B,2,,2017-10-18 15:28:16.328469

THIS IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE IT REQUIRES AN ENERGETICALLY-FAVORABLE CHEMICAL PROCESS THAT CAN SYNTHESIZE A PAIR OF CODING MONOMERS CAPABLE OF TEMPLATE-DIRECTED POLYMERIZATION. FURTHERMORE  THE SYNTHETIC PROCESS NEEDS TO BE PREBIOTICALLY PLAUSIBLE  THAT IS  USE SIMPLE REACTANTS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PREBIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. PAST MODEL STUDIES OF PREBIOTIC CHEMICALLY-DRIVEN TEMPLATE-DIRECTED POLYMERIZATION HAVE USED EITHER PRE-ACTIVATED MONOMERS OR CHEMICAL CONDENSING AGENTS TO DRIVE MONOMER CONDENSATION REACTIONS. ALTHOUGH THESE STUDIES OF PREBIOTIC POLYMERIZATION HAVE YIELDED OLIGOMERIC PRODUCTS  THEY ARE GENERALLY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THE POLYMERIZATION STEP AND LEAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS CONCERNING HOW ADEQUATE CONCENTRATIONS OF THE HDROLYTICALLY LABILE ACTIVATING AGENTS NEEDED FOR POLYMERIZATION WERE MAINTAINED IN THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. TO APPROACH THIS QUESTION WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A SUGAR-DRIVEN  ONE-POT  SYNTHESIS OF A PAIR OF POTENTIALLY COMPLEMENTARY MONOMERS THAT CAN BE POLYMERIZED WITHOUT INVOLVEMENT OF A HYDROLYTICALLY LABILE CONDENSING AGENT. SPECIFICALLY  WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE SUGAR-DRIVEN SYNTHESIS AND POLYESTER-YIELDING POLYMERIZATION OF LACTIC ACID AND LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS THAT CONTAIN PYRAZIN-2-ONE AND 2-AMINOPYRAZINE GROUPS HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO ACT AS A PAIR OF RNA-LIKE CODING BASES IN A PRIMITIVE REPLICATING MOLECULE. THE LACTIC ACID MONOMERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED IN A  ONE-POT  SUGAR-DRIVEN REACTION FROM DIHYDROXYACETONE  GLYOXYLIC ACID AND ALANINE AMIDE FOR THE PYRAZIN-2-ONE MONOMER; AND FROM DIHYDROXYACETONE  GLYOXYLIC ACID AND GLYCINE AMIDINE FOR THE 2-AMINOPYRAZINE MONOMER. THE LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED SIMILARLY  EXCEPT THAT THE GLYOXYLIC ACID WILL BE REPLACED BY GLYOXAL. DRY-DOWN CONDITIONS WOULD BE USED TO POLYMERIZE THE  NUCLEOSIDE-LIKE  LACTIC ACID MONOMERS; WHEREAS  OXIDATIVE PROCESSES WILL BE USED TO POLYMERIZE THE  NUCLEOSIDE-LIKE   LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS. WE WOULD ALSO STUDY THE ABILITY OF THE LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS TO REVERSIBLY FORM HEMIACETAL-LINKED OLIGOMERS THAT COULD FACILITATE THEIR OXIDATIVE CONVERSION TO POLYESTER OLIGOMERS. THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGIN OF POLYMERIZATON PROCESSES REQUIRED FOR MOLECULAR REPLICATION. THE STRONG FLUORESCENCE OF THE PYRAZINE GROUPS WOULD FACILITATE DETECTION AND ANALYSIS BY HPLC/MS  GEL ELECTROPHORESIS OR HPLC WITH FLUORESCENCE AND UV DETECTION. THIS PROPOSAL AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE PREBIOTIC CHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT PROVIDED THE CARBON AND ENERGY REQUIRED FOR THE PREBIOTIC SYNTHESIS OF PYRAZINE MONOMERS AND POLYMERS  CONSIDERED MODELS OF PRE-RNA REPLICATING MOLECULES  SUPPORTS NASA'S EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM ELEMENT IN PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY THAT SEEKS TO DETERMINE ""WHAT CHEMICAL SYSTEMS COULD HAVE SERVED AS PRECURSORS OF METABOLIC AND REPLICATING SYSTEMS ON EARTH AND ELSEWHERE  INCLUDING ALTERNATIVES TO THE CURRENT DNA-RNAPROTEIN BASIS FOR LIFE."" ALSO  KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN THIS INVESTIGATION OF THE CHEMISTRY OF ABIOGENESIS CONTRIBUTES TO UNDERSTANDING THE ""MOLECULAR PROCESSES THAT SET THE CHEMICAL CONDITIONS WITHIN WHICH LIVING SYSTEMS MAY HAVE ARISEN"".

HOWEVER  THESE BIOSIGNATURES HAVE ONLY BEEN PRESENT FOR LESS THAN HALF THE EARTHS HISTORY  AND RECENT GEOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ATMOSPHERIC O2 MAY HAVE BEEN AT VERY LOW - LIKELY UNDETECTABLE - LEVELS  UNTIL 0.8 GA (PLANAVSKY ET AL.  2014). GIVEN THAT OUR PLANET WAS INHABITED FOR VERY LONG PERIODS PRIOR TO THE RISE OF OXYGEN  AND THAT A SIMILAR PERIOD OF ANOXYGENIC LIFE MAY OCCUR ON EXOPLANETS  MORE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CHARACTERIZE REMOTELY DETECTABLE BIOSIGNATURES ASSOCIATED WITH MORE EVOLUTIONARILY ANCIENT ANOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHS. THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSED MULTIDISCIPLINARY STUDY ARE TO MEASURE THE SURFACE REFLECTANCE SPECTRA OF ANOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHS  UNDERSTAND THE  RULES  THAT DICTATE THEIR SPECTRAL FEATURES SO THAT THEY CAN BE PREDICTED FOR EXOPLANETS  AND ASSESS THEIR REMOTE DETECTABILITY AS A FUNCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT ACROSS A RANGE OF SPATIAL SCALES: (1) LOCAL FIELD MEASUREMENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES  (2) REGIONAL ON MODERN EARTH (CONTINENTS AND OCEANS) USING AIRBORNE SENSORS AND EARTH-OBSERVING SATELLITES  AND (3) PLANETARY-SCALE IN EXOPLANETARY DISK-AVERAGED SPECTRA UNDER VARIOUS ATMOSPHERES AND CLOUD COVERAGE LEVELS. OUR PRELIMINARY MEASUREMENTS SHOW THAT PURE CULTURES OF ANOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHS PRODUCE NIR EDGE(S) IN THEIR SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE DUE TO ABSORPTION OF LIGHT BY BACTERIOCHLOROPHYLL (BCHL) PIGMENTS. WE ASSESSED THE DETECTABILITY OF THESE FEATURES ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES OF MICROBIAL MATS  AND OBSERVED MULTIPLE NIR EDGES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH PIGMENT. WE INITIALLY EXPECTED ONLY TO DETECT THE ABSORPTION OF LIGHT BY THE PIGMENTS IN THE SURFACE LAYER OF THE MAT. SURPRISINGLY  WE DETECTED CYANOBACTERIAL CHL A IN THE SURFACE LAYER  AS WELL AS BCHL C AND BCHL A IN THE ANOXYGENIC UNDERLAYERS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER WHO IS ON TOP  AS WE WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE PIGMENTS THROUGH ALL MAT LAYERS DUE TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABSORPTION MAXIMA. THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE PIGMENTS AND THUS MULTIPLE NIR EDGES COULD SIGNIFY LAYERED PHOTOTROPHIC COMMUNITIES AND POSSIBLY STRENGTHEN SUPPORT FOR THE DETECTION OF A SURFACE EXOPLANET BIOSIGNATURE. IN GENERAL  THE PROPOSED WORK WILL INFORM THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON EXOPLANETS AT A SIMILAR STAGE OF EVOLUTION OR BIOGEOCHEMICAL STATE AS THE PRE-OXIC EARTH.

THE DATA ANALYSIS AND RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELING PROPOSED FOR THIS WORK CONSTITUTES A SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING  SO THAT THE PI WILL BE HIRING A POSTDOC TO COLLABORATE WITH HIM IN DOING THIS WORK AND OTHER PROJECTS THAT THE PI IS INVOLVED IN. THE BULK OF THE ALLOCATED FUNDS WILL BE USED TO PARTIALLY FUND THIS POSTDOCTORAL CANDIDATE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ASPECT OF THE PI S WORK IS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE RINGS COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE EVOLVE OVER TIME DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF MICROMETEOROID BOMBARDMENT AND BALLISTIC TRANSPORT OF THEIR IMPACT EJECTA. THE RINGS HUGE SURFACE-AREATO MASS RATIO ENSURES THAT MICROMETEOROID IMPACTS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPOSITIONAL AND DYNAMICAL PROCESS  AND BY UNRAVELING THE EFFECTS OF BOMBARDMENT OVER THE RINGS LIFETIME  WE MAY GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR COMPOSITIONAL DIVERSITY  ORIGIN AND AGE. THE PI S AND COLLABORATOR S BALLISTIC TRANSPORT CODE ESTRADA ET AL.  2015 IS FULLY CAPABLE OF MODELING THE STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION AND BULK COMPOSITIONAL REDISTRIBUTION OF MATERIAL DUE TO THIS PROCESS OVER THE RADIAL EXTENT OF THE RINGS  AND OVER A WIDE RANGE OF PARAMETER SPACE THAT HAS SEEN STEADY REFINEMENT THROUGH CASSINI OBSERVATIONS. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST HAS BEEN THE REVELATION FROM THE CASSINI COSMIC DUST ANALYZER EXPERIMENT (CDA) THAT THE MICROMETEOROID FLUX AT SATURN IS COMPARABLE TO PREVIOUS ESTIMATES  OR COULD EVEN BE AS MUCH AS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER S. KEMPF  PRIV. COMM. FURTHERMORE  THE FLUX IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT POPULATION ALTOGETHER WHICH HAS ITS DYNAMICAL ORIGINS IN THE KUIPER BELT ALTOBELLI ET AL.  2015. THIS MEANS THAT THE FLUX IS MUCH MORE GRAVITATIONALLY FOCUSED THAN THE PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED COMETARY FLUX E.G.  CUZZI AND ESTRADA  1998 WITH THE RESULT BEING THAT THE IMPACT FLUX  THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF MATERIAL HITTING THE RINGS  IS OVER AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER FOR A GIVEN FLUX AT INFINITY. THIS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RING AGE AND EVOLUTION ESTRADA ET AL.  2017. FOR THIS PROPOSAL  OUR TASKS WILL FOCUS ON THE DETERMINATION OF SPECIFIC CANDIDATES FOR THE RINGS NON-ICY COMPOSITIONAL CONSTITUENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DATA ANALYSIS OF EXISTING CASSINI DATA  AND RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELING EMPLOYING A SUITE OF CODES WE HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED FOR THIS PURPOSE INCLUDING A RECENTLY COMPLETED MONTE CARLO RAY TRACING CODE BEAM. WE WILL MAKE USE OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE CASSINI DATA THAT INCLUDE VIMS-IR  AS WELL AS 8- AND 15-COLOR FILTER ISS DATA  WHICH ALLOW FOR A MULTIPLE WAVELENGTH REFLECTANCE STUDY  AS WELL AS UVIS OCCULTATION AND EVEN RADAR RADIOMETER DATA. THE AVAILABLE DATA IN THE PDS INCLUDES MANY ISS AND VIMS RADIAL SCANS  AND OVER 100 STELLAR OCCULTATIONS COVERING ALL RING REGIONS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF GEOMETRIES. ANALYSIS OF UVIS AND VIMS OCCULTATION DATA CONTINUES TO REFINE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF RING SURFACE DENSITY AND OPACITY WHICH WE USE IN OUR DYNAMICAL SIMULATIONS. DETERMINING THE NON-ICY COMPOSITIONAL CONSTITUENTS OF THE RINGS WILL INVOLVE RING LAYER RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODELING TO OBTAIN THE BEST-FIT COMBINATION OF PHASE FUNCTION  PACKING DENSITY  AND PARTICLE ALBEDO FROM THE OBSERVATIONS  AND RING PARTICLE RADIATIVE TRANSFER TO INFER PARTICLE COMPOSITION FROM THE ALBEDO. THE FORMER WILL INVOLVE THE USE OF OUR MONTE CARLO RAY-TRACING CODE WHICH CAN HANDLE LOCALLY INHOMOGENEOUS RING STRUCTURE SUCH AS CLUMPY AND AZIMUTHALLY ASYMMETRIC SELF-GRAVITY WAKES WHICH WE WILL CONSTRAIN USING UVIS STELLAR OCCULTATION DATA. THE LATTER WILL INVOLVE THE USE OF A PARTICLE REGOLITH RADIATIVE TRANSFER CODE TO INFER PARTICLE COMPOSITION. OUR PROPOSED WORK THUS COMBINES DATA ANALYSIS AND MODELING.

DRY PERMAFROST ABOVE ICE-CEMENTED GROUND  AND REGOLITH-ATMOSPHERE EXCHANGE OF WATER DOMINATED BY VAPOR DIFFUSION IS THE NORM ON MARS BUT IS RARE ON EARTH  AND IT IS ONLY FOUND IN PLACES LIKE UNIVERSITY VALLEY IN THE UPPER ELEVATIONS OF THE DRY VALLEYS IN ANTARCTICA. AS SUCH UNIVERSITY VALLEY REPRESENTS A UNIQUE FIELD SITE WHERE WE CAN STUDY POSSIBLE LIFE PROCESSES IN MARS ANALOGUE GROUND ICE  AS WELL AS THE PRESERVATION OF BIOMARKERS SUCH AS COMPLEX BIOMOLECULES THAT COULD BE TARGETED IN FUTURE LIFE DETECTION MISSIONS. I WILL ALSO CONDUCT A CONCEPT STUDY TO IMPLEMENT A DEEP DRILL IN THE SPACE X DRAGON CAPSULE. DRAGON HAS A CAPABILITY OF DELIVER SIGNIFICANT PAYLOADS (MORE THAN HUNDREDS OF KILOGRAMS) TO MARS. IN COLLABORATION WITH A NASA TEAM  I WILL DEFINE THE SCIENCE OBJECTIVE FOR A DRAGON DRILL MISSION THAT FOCUSES ON THE SEARCH FOR LIFE. BASED ON THIS  WE WILL DEFINE THE DRILL AND SAMPLING SYSTEMS BY CONSIDERING: (1) THE DRILLING MECHANISM BASED ON FIVE PROVEN NASA AMES DEEP-DRILL DESIGNS  (2) POWER SUPPLY  {3} MECHANISM TO CLEAR CUTTINGS  (4) SUPPORTING SCIENCE PAYLOAD  (5) SUPPORTING ENGINEERING PAYLOAD. WE WILL THEN DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION AND CONFIGURATION PLAN FOR PLACING THE DRILL PAYLOAD IN THE DRAGON CAPSULE. THE PAYLOAD CONCEPTS WILL INCORPORATE MASS AND POWER ESTIMATES STRESS MODELS  AND ESTIMATED COSTS. FINALLY WE WILL DEVELOP A CONCEPT FOR SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE OPERATIONS ON MARS DURING A DEEP-DRILLING MISSION  INCLUDING ACCESSING THE GROUND THROUGH THE LANDER  SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE SCIENCE ACTIVITIES  COMPLIANCE WITH PLANETARY PROTECTION PROTOCOLS  RELEVANCE TO PRESENT AND FUTURE MISSIONS  AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE ROBOTIC AND HUMAN EXPLORATION OF MARS.,NON,12,B,2,,2017-05-19 00:00:00

PROJECT SUMMARY: THE SETI INSTITUTE (SI) TEAM PROPOSES A RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT WILL DEVELOP A ROADMAP TO BIOSIGNATURE EXPLORATION IN SUPPORT OF NASA'S DECADAL PLAN FOR THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS.  THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY FOR NASA TO SEARCH FOR ANCIENT TRACES OF LIFE ON MARS WILL BE 2020  WHEN A CURIOSITY-CLASS ROVER IS EXPECTED TO EXPLORE ANCIENT HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS AND CACHE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SAMPLES.  CACHING SAMPLES IS HIGH-COST AND HIGH RISK  AND THE SINGLE MOST COMPELLING QUESTION TO ASK IN SUPPORT OF SUCH A MISSION IS: HOW DO WE IDENTIFY AND CACHE THE MOST VALUABLE SAMPLES?  THE SI MAKES THIS QUESTION THE INTELLECTUAL FOCUS OF IT RESEARCH PROGRAM.  FOUR RESEARCH AREAS STUDY THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THIS CENTRAL QUESTION.  WITHIN THEM FOCUS AREAS REGROUP INVESTIGATIONS THAT SYNERGISTICALLY TACKLE KEY ASPECTS OF EARLY MARS HABITABILITY  TAPHONOMIC WINDOWS AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL  THEIR PRESERVATION POTENTIAL  AND THEIR DETECTABILITY.  RESEARCH IS PERFORMED THROUGH AN INTEGRATED EXPLORATION OF EVER-INCREASING RESOLUTION THAT CORRELATES MEASUREMENT FROM MEGASCALE TO MOLECULAR SCALE  AND ENVISIONS EACH ESSENTIAL COMPONENT THROUGH THE UNIQUE PRISM OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING EARLY MARTIAN ENVIRONMENT.  ULTIMATELY  IT PRODUCES GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE TO RESEARCH  WHAT TO SEARCH FOR  AND HOW TO SEARCH.THE RESEARCH PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THE SI TEAM IS TIMELY  NEEDED  AND WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT A DECADE OF SEARCHES FOR LIFE ON MARS THAT MAY CULMINATE WITH A MARS SAMPLE RETURN MISSION.SCIENTIFICALLY  WE WILL CHARACTERIZE TERRESTRIAL ANALOGS TO ENVIRONMENTS AND BIOGEOMATERIALS CONSIDERED OF HIGH-PRIORITY TO THE SEARCH FOR TRACES OF ANCIENT LIFE ON MARS  AND WILL INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGING EARLY MARS CONDITIONS ON THE PRESERVATION OF BIOSIGNATURES.  INVESTIGATING THE PHYSICAL  BIMOLECULAR  AND METABOLIC RECORDS OF LIFE IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS  OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL DEFINE THEIR HABITABILITY POTENTIAL  TAPHONOMIC WINDOWS  POTENTIAL FOR BIOSIGNATURES AND THEIR PRESERVATION POTENTIAL.EXCELLENCE IN ASTROBIOLOGY  MARS TAPHONOMY  WORLD-CLASS LEADERSHIP IN THE EXPLORATION OF MARS ANALOGS  DEEP INVOLVEMENT IN MARS MISSIONS AND PROGRAMMATIC DECISIONS  AND ACCESS TO EXCEPTIONAL FIELD  LABORATORY AND INSTRUMENT ASSETS UNIQUELY POSITION THE SI TEAM TO BRING TO THE NAI THE MEANS OF PROVIDING CRITICAL EXPLORATION GUIDELINES TO SUPPORT THE SEARCH FOR LIFE THE MARS.",NON,M,B,2,,2017-10-05 18:22:49.764792

BRIGHTNESS FLUCTUATIONS ARISE FROM STARSPOTS  FLARES  ACCRETION  PROTOPLANETARY DISK OBSCURATION  AND ECLIPSES. MUCH EFFORT OVER THE PAST DECADES HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO CONNECTING LIGHT CURVE FEATURES WITH STELLAR AND CIRCUMSTELLAR PROPERTIES. YET THE NEAREST YOUNG STELLAR ASSOCIATIONS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN TOO SPATIALLY DISPERSED TO OBTAIN HIGH QUALITY LIGHT CURVES FOR MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF STARS. THE K2 MISSION IS RECTIFYING THIS SITUATION WITH EXQUISITE PHOTOMETRIC DATASETS ENCOMPASSING TENS OF DEGREES ON THE SKY. IN CAMPAIGN 2  WE MONITORED THE ~10 MYR UPPER SCORPIUS ASSOCIATION. NOW IN CAMPAIGN 13  WE PROPOSE TO GATHER LIGHT CURVES FOR 215 MEMBERS OF ~1-MYR-OLD TAURUS  ARGUABLY THE BEST STUDIED NEARBY STAR FORMING REGION. THE ENVISIONED COMBINATION OF K2 LIGHT CURVES  GROUND-BASED SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTROPOLARIMETERY  AS WELL AS DISK IMAGING WILL FURNISH A LEGACY DATASET FOR YEARS TO COME. IT WILL PROVIDE A VALUABLE COMPARISON TO THE PREEXISTING UPPER SCO DATA  SINCE THE YOUTHFUL TAURUS STARS ACCRETE MORE STRONGLY AND HOST MORE MASSIVE DISKS. OUR SCIENCE PROGRAM WILL CONSIST OF FOUR INTERTWINED AIMS: BY GATHERING HIGH-PRECISION LIGHT CURVES FOR TAURUS MEMBERS  WE WILL ASSESS THE ROTATION RATE DISTRIBUTION IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER YOUNG CLUSTERS; IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE ECLIPSING BINARIES; SEARCH FOR CIRCUMSTELLAR OBSCURATION EVENTS TO LEARN ABOUT THE INNER PROTOPLANETARY DISK; AND CORRELATE OBSERVED VARIABILITY PATTERNS WITH ACCRETION AND MAGNETIC FIELD GEOMETRY INFERRED FROM COMPLEMENTARY SPECTROPOLARIMETRIC OBSERVATIONS. FOR EACH SCIENCE GOAL  WE WILL DERIVE HIGH-PRECISION  SYSTEMATIC DETRENDED LIGHT CURVES FROM K2 PIPELINE PRODUCTS  AND WE WILL CLASSIFY THE VARIABILITY THEREIN USING ESTABLISHED STATISTICAL METRICS (E.G.  CODY ET AL. 2014). PHOTOMETRIC AMPLITUDES IN THE<1% TO 100+% RANGE ARE EXPECTED  WITH FLUCTUATIONS ON TIMESCALES FROM HOURS TO WEEKS. K2 IS THEREFORE WELL SUITED TO PROBING A WIDE RANGE OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH THESE YOUNG STARS. ONCE VARIABILITY PATTERNS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED  WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH HIGH RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY FOR ECLIPSING BINARIES OR PLANETARY TRANSITS  AND SPECTROPOLARIMETRY (CFHT/ESPADONS; SPIROU) FOR STARS WITH SIGNATURES OF ACCRETION BURSTS AND/OR PHOTOSPHERIC SPOTS. LIGHT CURVES WITH CIRCUMSTELLAR EXTINCTION EVENTS WILL BE COMPARED WITH KNOWN PROPERTIES FROM ONGOING MILLIMETER OBSERVATIONS FROM ALMA. THIS WORK WILL ESTABLISH STELLAR PROPERTIES SUCH AS MASSES AND RADII  AS WELL AS ILLUMINATE THE GEOMETRY OF THE INNER DISK AND ITS CONNECTION TO THE CENTRAL STAR. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF (CIRCUM-)STELLAR PROPERTIES AT THIS EARLY EPOCH IS IN DIRECT SUPPORT OF K2 S GOALS TO ENHANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF STELLAR AND PLANETARY ASTROPHYSICS.

IN THE FIRST THEME WE WILL BUILD ON OUR PREVIOUS IDEA THAT THE POST-GIANT IMPACT EARTH HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ANGULAR MOMENTUM THAN THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM POSSESSES TODAY. IN TASK 1.1 WE WILL EXAMINE HOW TIDAL DISSIPATION DRIVEN BY THE MOON'S OBLIQUITY AFFECTED LUNAR ORBITAL EVOLUTION. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE MOON EXPERIENCED HIGH OBLIQUITIES ABOUT 100~MYR OR SO AFTER ITS FORMATION  BUT PAST WORK ON LUNAR ORBIT HAS IGNORED DISSIPATION ASSOCIATED WITH OBLIQUITY. AS SCIENTISTS RECENTLY SHOWED  OBLIQUITY-DISSIPATION WITHIN THE MOON MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED ITS INCLINATION. WE WILL USE DIRECT NUMERICAL INTEGRATIONS TO EXAMINE THIS EFFECT IN A VARIETY OF LUNAR TIDAL EVOLUTION SCENARIOS. IN TASK 1.2 WE WILL APPLY NUMERICAL TOOLS DEVELOPED IN TASK 1.1 TO POST-GIANT IMPACT FAST-SPINNING EARTHS WITH HIGH OBLIQUITIES. OUR PRELIMINARY WORK SHOWS THAT A HIGH OBLIQUITY EARTH-MOON SYSTEM EXPERIENCES VERY COMPLEX DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION  WHICH INCLUDES EXCITATION OF LUNAR ECCENTRICITY AND INCLINATION  AS WELL AS DECREASE IN EARTH'S ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND OBLIQUITY. WE WILL USE NUMERICAL INTEGRATIONS TO DETERMINE IF AN ORIGINALLY HIGHLY INCLINED EARTH-MOON SYSTEM CAN ULTIMATELY EVOLVE INTO THE PRESENT CONFIGURATION. IN TASK 1.3  WE WILL EXAMINE HOW THIS COMPLEX ORBITAL AND ROTATIONAL HISTORY OF THE MOON AFFECTED THE COUPLING BETWEEN THE LUNAR CORE AND MANTLE WHICH LIKELY GENERATED THE ANCIENT LUNAR MAGNETIC FIELD. IN THE SECOND THEME  WE WILL USE SOME OF THE SAME NUMERICAL TOOLS TO STUDY THE PAST EVOLUTION OF TRITON. IN TASK 2.1  WE WILL DIRECTLY INTEGRATE THE VERY EARLIEST STAGE OF TRITON'S POST-CAPTURE HISTORY  WHEN IT LIKELY DESTABILIZED AND ACCRETED NEPTUNE'S PRE-EXISTING SATELLITES. WHILE ANALYTICAL ESTIMATES IN THE LITERATURE DISAGREE ON THE FATE OF PRIMORDIAL MOONS  DIRECT NUMERICAL INTEGRATIONS USING OUR INTEGRATOR OPTIMIZED FOR CROSSING ORBITS SHOULD RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. BULDING ON RESULTS OF SCIENTISTS  WE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THECOLLISION BETWEEN MOONS LEAD TO ACCRETION OR EROSION. IN TASK 2.2  WE WILL ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF THE PAST OBLIQUITY EVOLUTION OF TRITON  WHICH HAS A BEARING ON ITS ORBITAL EVOLUTION. OUR NUMERICAL METHOD CAN MODEL THE SPINDYNAMICS OF TRITON WITHOUT RECOURSE TO CASSINI STATES  AND WILL DETERMINE DIRECTLY WHEN THE SPIN SYNCHRONIZATION OCCURS AND WHICH CASSINI STATES TRITON OCCUPIED IN THE PAST.,NON,12,B,2,,2017-09-05 00:00:00

MAJOR ADVANCES IN EXOPLANET DETECTION PLACE HUMANITY ON THE BRINK OF FINALLY ANSWERING ASTROBIOLOGYS OVERARCHING QUESTION ARE WE ALONE BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY SCIENTIFIC STEPS REQUIRED BEFORE WE CAN IDENTIFY A LIVING WORLD BEYOND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. THE NASA KEPLER MISSION SHOWS US THAT TERRESTRIAL PLANETS ARE COMMON  BUT HOW DO WE RECOGNIZE A HABITABLE ONE.  ON THE HORIZON  THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE JWST MAY PROVIDE THE FIRST EVER PEEK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF A HABITABLE PLANET  BUT WILL LIKELY ONLY HAVE TIME TO STUDY ONE SUCH WORLD. WHEN OBSERVATIONS ARE CHALLENGING AND RESOURCES ARE SCARCE  WHICH PLANETS SHOULD WE SPEND TIME STUDYING. LONGER TERM MISSIONS  SUCH AS THE TERRESTRIAL PLANET FINDER TPF  MAY RETURN SPECTRA FROM A DIVERSITY OF WORLDS. WHAT SHOULD WE DESIGN TPF TO LOOK FOR  AND HOW DO WE RECOGNIZE SIGNS OF HABITABILITY AND LIFE FOR WORLDS WITH DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS  ORBITING STARS UNLIKE OUR OWN. THE VIRTUAL PLANETARY LABORATORY WILL SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE SCIENCE RETURN FROM NASA MISSIONS THAT DETECT AND CHARACTERIZE EXTRASOLAR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS. THE VPL INTEGRATES COMPUTER MODELING  LABORATORY AND FIELDWORK ACROSS A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF PLANETARY HABITABILITY AND BIO SIGNATURES. WE WILL USE ENVIRONMENTAL MODELS TO FURTHER CHARACTERIZE NEWLY DISCOVERED PLANETS FOR WHICH FOLLOW UP OBSERVATIONS ARE CHALLENGING OR NON EXISTENT  DEVELOP THE SCIENTIFIC FRAMEWORK TO PRIORITIZE TARGETS FOR FURTHER STUDY BY UPCOMING MISSIONS  DETERMINE THE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR REMOTE SENSING DETECTION OF HABITABILITY AND LIFE FOR A RANGE OF CURRENT AND PROPOSED SPACE BASED OBSERVATORIES  AND DEVELOP OPTIMAL RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES TO OBTAIN PLANETARY PROPERTIES FROM EXOPLANETARY SPECTRA. THE UNIFYING INTELLECTUAL FOCUS OF THE VIRTUAL PLANETARY LABORATORY IS TO LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE WHETHER AN EXTRASOLAR PLANET CAN OR DOES SUPPORT LIFE. ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WORK TOWARDS THAT SPECIFIC GOAL. TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL  WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE TEAM AND MODELING TOOLBOX REQUIRED TO ANALYZE PLANETARY HABITABILITY AS A MULTI DIMENSIONAL  INTERDISCIPLINARY PARAMETER SPACE. WE WILL USE THIS IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE OF PLANETARY HABITABILITY TO DETERMINE THE PLANETARY CHARACTERISTICS  AND THE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES REQUIRED TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN PLANETS WITH AND WITHOUT LIFE. THIS RESEARCH SUPPORTS NASA ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP GOALS 1  4  5 AND 7. THE VPL WILL EXPLORE THE EVOLUTION AND LIMITS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANET HABITABILITY VIA A PLANETS INTERACTION WITH ITS PARENT STAR AND PLANETARY SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT  AND IDENTIFY LIFES OBSERVABLE IMPACT ON A PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT FOR DIFFERENT METABOLISMS  PLANETARY COMPOSITIONS  AND HOST STARS. TO DO THIS  WE WILL DEVELOP  REFINE AND COMBINE 1D AND 3D CLIMATE  PHOTOCHEMICAL  RADIATIVE TRANSFER  ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE  PLANETARY INTERIOR  BIOGEOCHEMICAL  BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY  VEGETATION  ORBITAL EVOLUTION AND PLANET FORMATION MODELS. AS INPUT TO THESE MODELS WE WILL OBTAIN LABORATORY  FIELD AND OBSERVATIONAL DATA FROM THE STELLAR  PLANETARY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES. THE COMBINATION OF DATA AND MODELS WILL BE USED TO DERIVE A COMPREHENSIVE  INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERIZATION OF A GIVEN PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT AND ITS LIKELY HISTORY. WE WILL USE THESE RESULTS TO RECOGNIZE HABITABLE WORLDS AND TO DISCRIMINATE 2 BETWEEN THE SPECTRA OF PLANETS WITH AND WITHOUT LIFE  BY UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNATURES OF LIFE IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES  WE PROPOSE 5 INTERDISCIPLINARY AND STRONGLY INTERRELATED TASKS.

STUDIES OF THE OPTICAL LIGHTCURVES OF ASTEROIDS ALSO YIELD IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON SHAPE AND POTENTIAL BINARITY OF ASTEROIDAL BODIES. LIGHTCURVES OF HILDA AND TROJAN ASTEROIDS POPULATIONS YIELD KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIMORDIAL SHAPE AND BINARY FRACTION OF THESE SMALL BODY POPULATIONS AND THEIR ORIGINS. MILLI-MAG KEPLER PHOTOMETRY WILL TIGHTLY CONSTRAIN BOTH OF THE LATTER CHARACTERISTICS. THESE 2 POPULATIONS ARE IN RESONANCES WITH JUPITER&COLLISIONAL FREQUENCIES WITHIN THESE POPULATIONS ARE THE LOWEST WITHIN INNER SOLAR SYSTEM SMALL BODY POPULATIONS. RESULTS FROM THE WISE SURVEY SUGGEST THAT ~20% OF TROJANS&~40% OF HILDAS ARE EITHER EXTREMELY ELONGATED OBJECTS OR BINARIES. KEPLER OPTICAL LIGHT CURVES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THESE CONTROVERSIAL FINDINGS. GROUND BASED SURVEYS ARE NOT OPTIMAL FOR THIS TYPE OF PHOTOMETRIC VARIABILITY STUDY DUE TO LARGE AMOUNTS OF OBSERVING TIME REQUIRED&NIGHTLY ALIASING EFFECTS ON LIGHTCURVES. KEPLER HOWEVER IS IDEAL FOR THIS TYPE OF PHOTOMETRIC SURVEY OF ASTEROID VARIABILITY DUE TO THE PHOTOMETRIC STABILITY OF THE OBSERVING PLATFORM AND THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE C11 FIELD AND THE L4 TROJAN CLOUD. METHODOLOGY: WE HAVE IDENTIFIED 100 OBJECTS FOR STUDY IN THE HILDA AND TROJAN ASTEROIDS TO BE STUDIED WITH KEPLER IN C11-13 WITH MAGNITUDES OF MV<20. DUE TO THE OVERLAP BETWEEN THE CAMPAIGN 11 FIELD AND THE L4 TROJAN CLOUD  OUR REQUEST FOR DATA REPRESENTS 70 OBJECTS CAMPAIGN 11  23 OBJECTS IN CAMPAIGN 12&7 OBJECTS IN CAMPAIGN 13. THESE OBJECTS ARE NOT STATIONARY WITHIN THE KEPLER FIELDS  RATHER THEY MOVE ACROSS THE FIELD  RESULTING IN A MEAN TIME IN THE KEPLER FIELD OF VIEW ON ACTIVE SILICON OF 24 DAYS. DUE TO THE MOTION OF THESE TARGETS  THE KEPLER SCIENCE CENTER ASSESSES SOLAR SYSTEM PROGRAM AS CONTAINING MORE TARGETS THAN PROPOSED NUMBER OF OBJECTS  (IN C8  6 HILDA TARGETS ARE ASSESSED AS 4847 TARGETS BY THE KEPLER SCIENCE CENTER)  THUS THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGE PROPOSAL. WE WILL UTILIZE DATA OBTAINED WITH THE 30 MINUTE KEPLER CADENCE TO DETERMINE ROTATIONAL PERIODS FOR OUR SELECTED TARGETS. THE RATIO OF LIGHTCURVE AMPLITUDES WILL SUBSEQUENTLY BE UTILIZED TO DETERMINE BODY ELONGATION AND/OR BINARITY. RELEVANCE TO K2: THIS STUDY WILL OBTAIN HIGH FIDELITY LIGHTCURVES FOR SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS IN THE KEPLER FIELD OF VIEW DURING CAMPAIGNS 11-13 TO DETERMINE IF THESE OBJECTS ORIGINATED IN THE KUIPER BELT AND LATER MIGRATED AND ARE AMENABLE TO THE OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND CONSTRAINTS OF THE MISSION AND DEFINED OBSERVING FIELDS.,NON,12,A,2,,2017-03-06 00:00:00

UNDERSTANDING THE POLE DIRECTIONS AND SPIN RATES OF A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF NEAS IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE NEAR-EARTH POPULATION AS A WHOLE. KNOWING THE SPIN STATES OF INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS IS ALSO NECESSARY TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR SHAPES  TO PREDICT THEIR LONG-TERM TRAJECTORIES  AND FOR PLANNING SPACECRAFT MISSIONS. HOWEVER  POLE DIRECTIONS ARE CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ABOUT 75 NEAS.RADAR ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS USING THE HIGH-POWER TRANSMITTERS OF THE ARECIBO OBSERVATORY AND THE GOLDSTONE SOLAR SYSTEM RADAR CAN PROVIDE THE HIGHEST-RESOLUTION CHARACTERIZATION OF NEA SPIN STATES AND SHAPES OF ANY GROUND-BASED TECHNIQUE  OFTEN COMPARABLE TO A SPACECRAFT FLYBY. HOWEVER  RADAR IMAGING FREQUENTLY PROVIDES ONLY AMBIGUOUS CONSTRAINTS ON THE SPIN STATES AND SHAPES OF RADAR TARGETS. RADAR SPECKLE TRACKING ALLOWS UNAMBIGUOUS SPIN STATE MEASUREMENTS FOR MANY OF THE BEST NEA RADAR TARGETS BY TRACKING THE MOTION OF A TARGET S RADAR ECHO PATTERN BETWEEN MULTIPLE RECEIVE STATIONS SPREAD ACROSS HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS. SPIN STATE MEASUREMENTS FROM SPECKLE TRACKING CAN ALLOW US TO ESTIMATE THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL SHAPES OF NEAS WHEN WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNABLE TO DO SO. FOR EXAMPLE: RADAR SPECKLE TRACKING WAS ESSENTIAL TO DETERMINE THE SPIN STATE AND SHAPE OF 2008 EV5  NOW THE PRIMARY TARGET FOR THE ASTEROID REDIRECT ROBOTIC MISSION. SPECKLE OBSERVATIONS HAVE BECOME A ROUTINE PART OF RADAR OBSERVING CAMPAIGNS. WE PROPOSE TO CONTINUE SPECKLE OBSERVATIONS  INVESTIGATING THE SPIN STATES OF ABOUT 10 RADAR TARGETS PER YEAR. THE NUMBER OF SPECKLE TARGETS OBSERVED COULD BE GREATER IF THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF RADAR OBSERVING TIME INCREASES. WE WILL TRANSMIT WITH ARECIBO OR GOLDSTONE AND RECEIVE WITH ELEMENTS OF THE VERY LONG BASELINE ARRAY (VLBA). THE SPIN STATE CONSTRAINTS FROM RADAR SPECKLE TRACKING WILL BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH RADAR IMAGING DATA TO PRODUCE COMBINED SHAPE AND SPIN STATE MODELS AND IMPROVED TRAJECTORY PREDICTIONS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED KNOWN NEAS THAT CAN BE OBSERVED WITH SPECKLE TRACKING  BUT THE MAJORITY OF OUR SPECKLE TARGETS WILL BE NEW DISCOVERIES. WE WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS ASTEROIDS AND TO ACCESSIBLE SPACECRAFT MISSION TARGETS. THE NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY HAS ALREADY ALLOCATED OBSERVING TIME FOR RADAR SPECKLE RECEIVE WITH THE VLBA THROUGH THE END OF 2018. WE WILL PROPOSE FOR ADDITIONAL VLBA TIME IN MID-2018.

THIS WORK WILL ACCOUNT FOR IMPORTANT PHYSICAL PROCESSES HERETOFORE NEGLECTED AND THEREBY PROVIDE A MUCH MORE REALISTIC MODEL FOR THE FORMATION AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF THE GIANT PLANETS. DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF GIANT PLANET ACCRETION  WITH A ROCKY CORE OF AROUND AN EARTH MASS  THE BASAL TEMPERATURE OF THE HYDROGEN ATMOSPHERE ABOVE THIS GROWING CORE CAN ALREADY EXCEED A FEW THOUSAND DEGREES  SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW EVAPORATION OF ACCRETED PLANETESIMALS WITHIN THE ENVELOPE. THIS MAY AFFECT THE GROWTH OF THE GIANT PLANET  PRIMARILY BY INCREASING THE MEAN MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF THE ENVELOPE (REDUCING THE PRESSURE SCALE HEIGHT)  AND IT MAY ALSO PRODUCE A WIDER RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FOR GIANT PLANET FORMATION THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY STUDIED. THE CONSEQUENCES MAY BE PARTIALLY PRESERVED THROUGHOUT SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION AND INFLUENCE THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE GIANT PLANETS TODAY. TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF THIS PROCESS  WE WILL COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF MIXING OF THE CONSTITUENTS WITHIN THE PLANETS DURING THEIR GROWTH. THIS ADDITIONAL PHYSICS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO DETAILED NUMERICAL STUDIES OF THE CONCURRENT ACCRETION OF SOLIDS AND GAS  INCLUDING AN IMPROVED TREATMENT OF INTERACTIONS OF THE GROWING PLANETS WITH THE SURROUNDING PROTOPLANETARY DISK.,NON,M,A,2,,2017-10-05 18:23:04.383098

GPI WILL SEE FIRST LIGHT THIS FALL. IT WILL BE THE MOST ADVANCED PLANET IMAGING SYSTEM IN OPERATION  AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MORE SENSITIVE THAN ANY CURRENT INSTRUMENT  CAPABLE OF DETECTING AND SPECTROSCOPICALLY CHARACTERIZING YOUNG JOVIAN PLANETS 107 TIMES FAINTER THAN THEIR PARENT STAR AT SEPARATIONS OF 0.2 ARCSECONDS. GPI WAS BUILT FROM THE BEGINNING AS A FACILITY CLASS SURVEY INSTRUMENT  AND THE OBSERVATORY WILL EMPLOY IT THAT WAY. OUR TEAM HAS BEEN SELECTED BY GEMINI OBSERVATORY TO CARRY OUT AN 890-HOUR PROGRAM  THE GPI EXOPLANET SURVEY (GPIES) CAMPAIGN FROM 2014-2017. WE WILL OBSERVE 600 STARS SPANNING SPECTRAL TYPES A-M. WE WILL USE PUBLISHED YOUNG ASSOCIATION CATALOGS AND A PROPRIETARY LIST IN PREPARATION THAT ADDS SEVERAL HUNDRED NEW YOUNG (100 MYR  75 PC) AND ADOLESCENT (300 MYR  35 PC) STARS. THE RANGE OF SEPARATIONS STUDIED BY GPI IS COMPLETELY INACCESSIBLE TO DOPPLER AND TRANSIT TECHNIQUES (EVEN WITH KEPLER OR TESS)GPI OFFERS A NEW WINDOW INTO PLANET FORMATION. WE WILL USE GPI TO PRODUCE THE FIRST-EVER ROBUST CENSUS OF GIANT PLANET POPULATIONS IN THE 5-50 AU RANGE  ALLOWING US TO 1) ILLUMINATE THE FORMATION PATHWAYS OF JOVIAN PLANETS 2) RECONSTRUCT THE EARLY DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION OF SYSTEMS  INCLUDING MIGRATION MECHANISMS AND THE INTERACTION WITH DISKS AND BELTS OF DEBRIS AND 3) BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN JUPITER AND THE BROWN DWARFS WITH THE FIRST EXAMPLES OF COOL LOW-GRAVITY PLANETARY ATMOSPHERES. SIMULATIONS PREDICT THIS SURVEY WILL DISCOVER APPROXIMATELY 50 EXOPLANETS  INCREASING THE NUMBER OF EXOPLANET IMAGES BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE  ENOUGH FOR STATISTICAL INVESTIGATION. THIS ORIGINS OF SOLAR SYSTEMS PROPOSAL WILL SUPPORT THE EXECUTION OF THE GPI EXOPLANET SURVEY CAMPAIGN. WE WILL DEVELOP TOOLS NEEDED TO EXECUTE THE SURVEY EFFICIENTLY. WE WILL REFINE THE EXISTING GPI DATA PIPELINE TO A FINAL VERSION THAT ROBUSTLY REMOVES RESIDUAL SPECKLE ARTIFACTS AND PROVIDES ACCURATE AND CALIBRATED RECOVERY OF EXOPLANET SPECTRA. WE WILL PRODUCE A COMPLETE ARCHIVE OF ALL REDUCED  GPI DATA PRODUCTS SUPPLEMENTING THE EXISTING GEMINI ARCHIVE OF RAW DATA FOR USE BY OUR COLLABORATION  AND RELEASE THAT ARCHIVE TO THE PUBLIC ON AN 18 MONTH CYCLE. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WILL EXECUTE THE GPI OBSERVATIONS  INITIALLY THROUGH CLASSICAL TELESCOPE VISITS  TRANSITIONING TO REMOTE AND QUEUE MODES AS OUR TECHNIQUES ARE REFINED. AS THE FIRST DIRECT IMAGING PLANET SEARCH WITH STATISTICAL DEPTH COMPARABLE TO DOPPLER PLANET DETECTION AND THE FIRST TO PROBE INTO THE SNOW LINE  THE GPI EXOPLANET SURVEY WILL PROVIDE STRONG CONSTRAINTS ON PARADIGMS FOR PLANET FORMATION  COMPLETING THE PICTURE OF THE GIANT PLANET DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT OTHER SOLAR SYSTEMS  AND ALSO ILLUMINATING ITS EVOLUTION WITH STELLAR AGE AND MASS. WE WILL DELIVER A CATALOG OF DETECTED EXOPLANETS THE PRINCIPAL LEGACY OF THIS CAMPAIGN RELEASED FOR FOLLOW-UP BY THE ASTRONOMICAL COMMUNITY WITHIN 18 MONTHS OF OBSERVATION  AS WELL AS SEARCHABLE ARCHIVE OF FULLY REDUCED IMAGES AND DETECTION LIMITS FOR ALL STARS SURVEYED. FOR EACH DETECTED PLANET  WE WILL PRODUCE ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURES  LUMINOSITIES  AND SEMI-MAJOR AXES FOR A SUBSET  HIGH-SNR FIDUCIAL SPECTRA  ORBITAL ECCENTRICITIES  AND DYNAMICAL CHARACTERIZATION THROUGH POLARIMETRIC IMAGING OF ATTENDANT DEBRIS DISKS.  GPI WILL COMPLETE FINAL ACCEPTANCE TESTING THIS MONTH (MAY 2013) AND IS NOW READY TO SHIP TO CHILE FOR FIRST LIGHT IN SEPTEMBER 2013. THE GPI SURVEY WILL PROVIDE THE BEST-YET VIEW OF THE NATURE OF WIDE-ORBIT PLANETARY COMPANIONS  INFORMING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF SOLAR SYSTEM FORMATION TO GUIDE FUTURE NASA PLANET HUNTING MISSIONS  WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY OFFERING A REAL WORLD PROGRAM USING THE TECHNIQUES FROM INTEGRAL FIELD SPECTROSCOPY TO ADVANCED CORONAGRAPHY THAT WILL SOMEDAY BE USED TO DIRECTLY IMAGE EARTHLIKE PLANETS FROM SPACE.,NON,12,B,2,,2017-05-19 00:00:00

THIS IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE IT REQUIRES AN ENERGETICALLY-FAVORABLE CHEMICAL PROCESS THAT CAN SYNTHESIZE A PAIR OF CODING MONOMERS CAPABLE OF TEMPLATE-DIRECTED POLYMERIZATION. FURTHERMORE  THE SYNTHETIC PROCESS NEEDS TO BE PREBIOTICALLY PLAUSIBLE  THAT IS  USE SIMPLE REACTANTS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PREBIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. PAST MODEL STUDIES OF PREBIOTIC CHEMICALLY-DRIVEN TEMPLATE-DIRECTED POLYMERIZATION HAVE USED EITHER PRE-ACTIVATED MONOMERS OR CHEMICAL CONDENSING AGENTS TO DRIVE MONOMER CONDENSATION REACTIONS. ALTHOUGH THESE STUDIES OF PREBIOTIC POLYMERIZATION HAVE YIELDED OLIGOMERIC PRODUCTS  THEY ARE GENERALLY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THE POLYMERIZATION STEP AND LEAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS CONCERNING HOW ADEQUATE CONCENTRATIONS OF THE HDROLYTICALLY LABILE ACTIVATING AGENTS NEEDED FOR POLYMERIZATION WERE MAINTAINED IN THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. TO APPROACH THIS QUESTION WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A SUGAR-DRIVEN  ONE-POT  SYNTHESIS OF A PAIR OF POTENTIALLY COMPLEMENTARY MONOMERS THAT CAN BE POLYMERIZED WITHOUT INVOLVEMENT OF A HYDROLYTICALLY LABILE CONDENSING AGENT. SPECIFICALLY  WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE SUGAR-DRIVEN SYNTHESIS AND POLYESTER-YIELDING POLYMERIZATION OF LACTIC ACID AND LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS THAT CONTAIN PYRAZIN-2-ONE AND 2-AMINOPYRAZINE GROUPS HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO ACT AS A PAIR OF RNA-LIKE CODING BASES IN A PRIMITIVE REPLICATING MOLECULE. THE LACTIC ACID MONOMERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED IN A  ONE-POT  SUGAR-DRIVEN REACTION FROM DIHYDROXYACETONE  GLYOXYLIC ACID AND ALANINE AMIDE FOR THE PYRAZIN-2-ONE MONOMER; AND FROM DIHYDROXYACETONE  GLYOXYLIC ACID AND GLYCINE AMIDINE FOR THE 2-AMINOPYRAZINE MONOMER. THE LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED SIMILARLY  EXCEPT THAT THE GLYOXYLIC ACID WILL BE REPLACED BY GLYOXAL. DRY-DOWN CONDITIONS WOULD BE USED TO POLYMERIZE THE  NUCLEOSIDE-LIKE  LACTIC ACID MONOMERS; WHEREAS  OXIDATIVE PROCESSES WILL BE USED TO POLYMERIZE THE  NUCLEOSIDE-LIKE   LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS. WE WOULD ALSO STUDY THE ABILITY OF THE LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS TO REVERSIBLY FORM HEMIACETAL-LINKED OLIGOMERS THAT COULD FACILITATE THEIR OXIDATIVE CONVERSION TO POLYESTER OLIGOMERS. THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGIN OF POLYMERIZATON PROCESSES REQUIRED FOR MOLECULAR REPLICATION. THE STRONG FLUORESCENCE OF THE PYRAZINE GROUPS WOULD FACILITATE DETECTION AND ANALYSIS BY HPLC/MS  GEL ELECTROPHORESIS OR HPLC WITH FLUORESCENCE AND UV DETECTION. THIS PROPOSAL AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE PREBIOTIC CHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT PROVIDED THE CARBON AND ENERGY REQUIRED FOR THE PREBIOTIC SYNTHESIS OF PYRAZINE MONOMERS AND POLYMERS  CONSIDERED MODELS OF PRE-RNA REPLICATING MOLECULES  SUPPORTS NASA'S EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM ELEMENT IN PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY THAT SEEKS TO DETERMINE ""WHAT CHEMICAL SYSTEMS COULD HAVE SERVED AS PRECURSORS OF METABOLIC AND REPLICATING SYSTEMS ON EARTH AND ELSEWHERE  INCLUDING ALTERNATIVES TO THE CURRENT DNA-RNAPROTEIN BASIS FOR LIFE."" ALSO  KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN THIS INVESTIGATION OF THE CHEMISTRY OF ABIOGENESIS CONTRIBUTES TO UNDERSTANDING THE ""MOLECULAR PROCESSES THAT SET THE CHEMICAL CONDITIONS WITHIN WHICH LIVING SYSTEMS MAY HAVE ARISEN"".

MAJOR ADVANCES IN EXOPLANET DETECTION PLACE HUMANITY ON THE BRINK OF FINALLY ANSWERING ASTROBIOLOGYS OVERARCHING QUESTION ARE WE ALONE BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY SCIENTIFIC STEPS REQUIRED BEFORE WE CAN IDENTIFY A LIVING WORLD BEYOND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. THE NASA KEPLER MISSION SHOWS US THAT TERRESTRIAL PLANETS ARE COMMON  BUT HOW DO WE RECOGNIZE A HABITABLE ONE.  ON THE HORIZON  THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE JWST MAY PROVIDE THE FIRST EVER PEEK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF A HABITABLE PLANET  BUT WILL LIKELY ONLY HAVE TIME TO STUDY ONE SUCH WORLD. WHEN OBSERVATIONS ARE CHALLENGING AND RESOURCES ARE SCARCE  WHICH PLANETS SHOULD WE SPEND TIME STUDYING. LONGER TERM MISSIONS  SUCH AS THE TERRESTRIAL PLANET FINDER TPF  MAY RETURN SPECTRA FROM A DIVERSITY OF WORLDS. WHAT SHOULD WE DESIGN TPF TO LOOK FOR  AND HOW DO WE RECOGNIZE SIGNS OF HABITABILITY AND LIFE FOR WORLDS WITH DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS  ORBITING STARS UNLIKE OUR OWN. THE VIRTUAL PLANETARY LABORATORY WILL SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE SCIENCE RETURN FROM NASA MISSIONS THAT DETECT AND CHARACTERIZE EXTRASOLAR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS. THE VPL INTEGRATES COMPUTER MODELING  LABORATORY AND FIELDWORK ACROSS A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF PLANETARY HABITABILITY AND BIO SIGNATURES. WE WILL USE ENVIRONMENTAL MODELS TO FURTHER CHARACTERIZE NEWLY DISCOVERED PLANETS FOR WHICH FOLLOW UP OBSERVATIONS ARE CHALLENGING OR NON EXISTENT  DEVELOP THE SCIENTIFIC FRAMEWORK TO PRIORITIZE TARGETS FOR FURTHER STUDY BY UPCOMING MISSIONS  DETERMINE THE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR REMOTE SENSING DETECTION OF HABITABILITY AND LIFE FOR A RANGE OF CURRENT AND PROPOSED SPACE BASED OBSERVATORIES  AND DEVELOP OPTIMAL RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES TO OBTAIN PLANETARY PROPERTIES FROM EXOPLANETARY SPECTRA. THE UNIFYING INTELLECTUAL FOCUS OF THE VIRTUAL PLANETARY LABORATORY IS TO LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE WHETHER AN EXTRASOLAR PLANET CAN OR DOES SUPPORT LIFE. ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WORK TOWARDS THAT SPECIFIC GOAL. TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL  WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE TEAM AND MODELING TOOLBOX REQUIRED TO ANALYZE PLANETARY HABITABILITY AS A MULTI DIMENSIONAL  INTERDISCIPLINARY PARAMETER SPACE. WE WILL USE THIS IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE OF PLANETARY HABITABILITY TO DETERMINE THE PLANETARY CHARACTERISTICS  AND THE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES REQUIRED TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN PLANETS WITH AND WITHOUT LIFE. THIS RESEARCH SUPPORTS NASA ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP GOALS 1  4  5 AND 7. THE VPL WILL EXPLORE THE EVOLUTION AND LIMITS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANET HABITABILITY VIA A PLANETS INTERACTION WITH ITS PARENT STAR AND PLANETARY SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT  AND IDENTIFY LIFES OBSERVABLE IMPACT ON A PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT FOR DIFFERENT METABOLISMS  PLANETARY COMPOSITIONS  AND HOST STARS. TO DO THIS  WE WILL DEVELOP  REFINE AND COMBINE 1D AND 3D CLIMATE  PHOTOCHEMICAL  RADIATIVE TRANSFER  ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE  PLANETARY INTERIOR  BIOGEOCHEMICAL  BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY  VEGETATION  ORBITAL EVOLUTION AND PLANET FORMATION MODELS. AS INPUT TO THESE MODELS WE WILL OBTAIN LABORATORY  FIELD AND OBSERVATIONAL DATA FROM THE STELLAR  PLANETARY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES. THE COMBINATION OF DATA AND MODELS WILL BE USED TO DERIVE A COMPREHENSIVE  INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERIZATION OF A GIVEN PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT AND ITS LIKELY HISTORY. WE WILL USE THESE RESULTS TO RECOGNIZE HABITABLE WORLDS AND TO DISCRIMINATE 2 BETWEEN THE SPECTRA OF PLANETS WITH AND WITHOUT LIFE  BY UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNATURES OF LIFE IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES  WE PROPOSE 5 INTERDISCIPLINARY AND STRONGLY INTERRELATED TASKS.  THE FIRST FOUR TASKS PROVIDE A SUITE OF SELF CONSISTENT PLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROGRESS FROM BEING PREDOMINANTLY DATA TO MODEL CONSTRAINED.

ASSUMING THAT STARLIGHT REJECTION SUFFICIENT FOR PLANET DETECTION (~1E-9) CAN BE ACHIEVED  WHAT CAN BE LEARNED ABOUT THESE PLANETS GIVEN A REALISTIC SPECTRAL RESOLUTION AND SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO? WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL FOR WFIRST TO EFFICIENTLY DISCRIMINATE PLANETS FROM BACKGROUND SOURCES  AND TO CHARACTERIZE PLANETS IN TERMS OF IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC ATMOSPHERIC FEATURES  USING BROAD- AND INTERMEDIATE BAND COLOR DATA. WE WILL MAP OUT THIS CAPABILITY AS A FUNCTION OF SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO  BANDPASS LOCATION  AND BANDPASS WIDTH.   OUR INVESTIGATION WILL PLACE EMPHASIS ON GAS GIANTS  ICE GIANTS  AND MINI-NEPTUNES (COMPATIBLE WITH CURRENT AFTA-C BASELINE PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS)  AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF SUPER-EARTHS (AN AFTA-C ""STRETCH"" GOAL). WE WILL EXPLORE A VARIETY OF COMPOSITIONS  CLOUD TYPES  PHASE ANGLES  AND (IN THE CASE OF SUPER-EARTHS WITH SEMI-TRANSPARENT ATMOSPHERES) SURFACE TYPES. NOISELESS SPECTRA GENERATED FOR THESE MODEL PLANETS WILL BE PASSED THROUGH (A) STANDARD BANDPASSES FOR COMPARISON TO PRIOR WORK AND (B) FILTER TRANSMISSION CURVES CORRESPONDING TO BANDPASSES OF 5-20% OVER THE FULL RANGE OF WFIRST'S EXPECTED BANDPASS (400 - 1 000 NM). FROM THIS  FILTER COMBINATIONS WILL BE USED TO GENERATE PLANET COLORS AND FIND FILTER SETS THAT MOST EFFICIENTLY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN PLANETS AND BACKGROUND SOURCES  AND BETWEEN PLANETS OF DIFFERENT TYPE. WE WILL THEN REPEAT THIS EXERCISE FOR S/N LEVELS OF 1-1 000 IN ORDER TO (1) EXPLORE THE TRUE EFFICACY OF BROADBAND MEASUREMENTS IN EXOPLANET STUDIES  AND (2) PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF TOTAL REQUIRED INTEGRATION TIME FOR A COMPELLING WFIRST EXOPLANET PROGRAM.  TO ACCOMPLISH THIS  WE WILL USE MODEL SPECTRA FOR MINI-NEPTUNES  AND ICE AND GAS GIANTS OF VARYING COMPOSITION (HU ET AL. 2013)  AND OBSERVED SPECTRA FOR SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS (JUPITER  SATURN  URANUS  NEPTUNE  AND TITAN; KARCOSCHKA 1994). WE WILL ALSO USE OBSERVED SCIAMACHY SPECTRA FOR THE DESERT  OCEAN  FOREST  AND ICY EARTH  IN ORDER TO BUILD A DIVERSE SET OF SPATIALLY INTEGRATED SUPER-EARTH SPECTRA  PLUS VARIATIONS IN ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION. SIMULATED OBSERVED SPECTRA WILL BE GENERATED FOR PLANETS PLACED UNDER THE IRRADIANCE OF STELLAR SPECTRAL TYPES CORRESPONDING TO WFIRST'S HIGHEST PRIORITY TARGETS FOR EXOPLANET IMAGING (APPROXIMATELY K5V THROUGH F5V). THE COLORS EXTRACTED FROM THESE SPECTRA WILL BE COMPARED TO COLORS EXTRACTED FROM SPECTRA FOR A WIDE RANGE OF LIKELY EXTRAGALACTIC SOURCES (BRUZUAL&CHARLOTT 2003) AND EXTINCTED STELLAR BACKGROUND SOURCES.   FINALLY  WE WILL ASSESS THE ""BACKGROUND THREAT"" FOR THE 100 MOST FAVORABLE TARGETS FOR EXOPLANET IMAGING WITH WFIRST. THIS FLAG WILL BE ASSIGNED BASED ON NUMBER AND TYPE OF BACKGROUND SOURCES EXPECTED AT VARIOUS GALACTIC LATITUDES  AND THE ABOVE RESULTS INDICATING HOW READILY SUCH SOURCES CAN BE DISCRIMINATED FROM EXOPLANETS.    AS A RESULT OF THIS INTENSIVE  THREE YEAR EFFORT  WE WILL DELIVER TO THE COMMUNITY A LIBRARY OF PLANET SPECTRA AND COLORS IN STANDARD AND PROPOSED ""DESIGNER"" PASSBANDS FOR PLANETS OF ALL TYPES UNDER STARS OF VARYING SPECTRAL TYPE  PLUS COLORS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF EXPECTED STELLAR AND EXTRAGALACTIC BACKGROUND SOURCES. THESE DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE WORK IN SIMULATING IMAGES AND EVENTUAL ""DOUBLE BLIND"" STUDIES IN EXTRACTING PLANET SOURCES AND ATMOSPHERIC SIGNATURES.

THIS IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE IT REQUIRES AN ENERGETICALLY-FAVORABLE CHEMICAL PROCESS THAT CAN SYNTHESIZE A PAIR OF CODING MONOMERS CAPABLE OF TEMPLATE-DIRECTED POLYMERIZATION. FURTHERMORE  THE SYNTHETIC PROCESS NEEDS TO BE PREBIOTICALLY PLAUSIBLE  THAT IS  USE SIMPLE REACTANTS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PREBIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. PAST MODEL STUDIES OF PREBIOTIC CHEMICALLY-DRIVEN TEMPLATE-DIRECTED POLYMERIZATION HAVE USED EITHER PRE-ACTIVATED MONOMERS OR CHEMICAL CONDENSING AGENTS TO DRIVE MONOMER CONDENSATION REACTIONS. ALTHOUGH THESE STUDIES OF PREBIOTIC POLYMERIZATION HAVE YIELDED OLIGOMERIC PRODUCTS  THEY ARE GENERALLY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THE POLYMERIZATION STEP AND LEAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS CONCERNING HOW ADEQUATE CONCENTRATIONS OF THE HDROLYTICALLY LABILE ACTIVATING AGENTS NEEDED FOR POLYMERIZATION WERE MAINTAINED IN THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. TO APPROACH THIS QUESTION WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A SUGAR-DRIVEN  ONE-POT  SYNTHESIS OF A PAIR OF POTENTIALLY COMPLEMENTARY MONOMERS THAT CAN BE POLYMERIZED WITHOUT INVOLVEMENT OF A HYDROLYTICALLY LABILE CONDENSING AGENT. SPECIFICALLY  WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE SUGAR-DRIVEN SYNTHESIS AND POLYESTER-YIELDING POLYMERIZATION OF LACTIC ACID AND LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS THAT CONTAIN PYRAZIN-2-ONE AND 2-AMINOPYRAZINE GROUPS HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO ACT AS A PAIR OF RNA-LIKE CODING BASES IN A PRIMITIVE REPLICATING MOLECULE. THE LACTIC ACID MONOMERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED IN A  ONE-POT  SUGAR-DRIVEN REACTION FROM DIHYDROXYACETONE  GLYOXYLIC ACID AND ALANINE AMIDE FOR THE PYRAZIN-2-ONE MONOMER; AND FROM DIHYDROXYACETONE  GLYOXYLIC ACID AND GLYCINE AMIDINE FOR THE 2-AMINOPYRAZINE MONOMER. THE LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED SIMILARLY  EXCEPT THAT THE GLYOXYLIC ACID WILL BE REPLACED BY GLYOXAL. DRY-DOWN CONDITIONS WOULD BE USED TO POLYMERIZE THE  NUCLEOSIDE-LIKE  LACTIC ACID MONOMERS; WHEREAS  OXIDATIVE PROCESSES WILL BE USED TO POLYMERIZE THE  NUCLEOSIDE-LIKE   LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS. WE WOULD ALSO STUDY THE ABILITY OF THE LACTALDEHYDE MONOMERS TO REVERSIBLY FORM HEMIACETAL-LINKED OLIGOMERS THAT COULD FACILITATE THEIR OXIDATIVE CONVERSION TO POLYESTER OLIGOMERS. THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGIN OF POLYMERIZATON PROCESSES REQUIRED FOR MOLECULAR REPLICATION. THE STRONG FLUORESCENCE OF THE PYRAZINE GROUPS WOULD FACILITATE DETECTION AND ANALYSIS BY HPLC/MS  GEL ELECTROPHORESIS OR HPLC WITH FLUORESCENCE AND UV DETECTION. THIS PROPOSAL AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE PREBIOTIC CHEMICAL PROCESSES THAT PROVIDED THE CARBON AND ENERGY REQUIRED FOR THE PREBIOTIC SYNTHESIS OF PYRAZINE MONOMERS AND POLYMERS  CONSIDERED MODELS OF PRE-RNA REPLICATING MOLECULES  SUPPORTS NASA'S EXOBIOLOGY PROGRAM ELEMENT IN PREBIOTIC CHEMISTRY THAT SEEKS TO DETERMINE ""WHAT CHEMICAL SYSTEMS COULD HAVE SERVED AS PRECURSORS OF METABOLIC AND REPLICATING SYSTEMS ON EARTH AND ELSEWHERE  INCLUDING ALTERNATIVES TO THE CURRENT DNA-RNAPROTEIN BASIS FOR LIFE."" ALSO  KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN THIS INVESTIGATION OF THE CHEMISTRY OF ABIOGENESIS CONTRIBUTES TO UNDERSTANDING THE ""MOLECULAR PROCESSES THAT SET THE CHEMICAL CONDITIONS WITHIN WHICH LIVING SYSTEMS MAY HAVE ARISEN"".

PROJECT SUMMARY: THE SETI INSTITUTE (SI) TEAM PROPOSES A RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT WILL DEVELOP A ROADMAP TO BIOSIGNATURE EXPLORATION IN SUPPORT OF NASA'S DECADAL PLAN FOR THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS.  THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY FOR NASA TO SEARCH FOR ANCIENT TRACES OF LIFE ON MARS WILL BE 2020  WHEN A CURIOSITY-CLASS ROVER IS EXPECTED TO EXPLORE ANCIENT HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS AND CACHE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SAMPLES.  CACHING SAMPLES IS HIGH-COST AND HIGH RISK  AND THE SINGLE MOST COMPELLING QUESTION TO ASK IN SUPPORT OF SUCH A MISSION IS: HOW DO WE IDENTIFY AND CACHE THE MOST VALUABLE SAMPLES?  THE SI MAKES THIS QUESTION THE INTELLECTUAL FOCUS OF IT RESEARCH PROGRAM.  FOUR RESEARCH AREAS STUDY THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THIS CENTRAL QUESTION.  WITHIN THEM FOCUS AREAS REGROUP INVESTIGATIONS THAT SYNERGISTICALLY TACKLE KEY ASPECTS OF EARLY MARS HABITABILITY  TAPHONOMIC WINDOWS AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL  THEIR PRESERVATION POTENTIAL  AND THEIR DETECTABILITY.  RESEARCH IS PERFORMED THROUGH AN INTEGRATED EXPLORATION OF EVER-INCREASING RESOLUTION THAT CORRELATES MEASUREMENT FROM MEGASCALE TO MOLECULAR SCALE  AND ENVISIONS EACH ESSENTIAL COMPONENT THROUGH THE UNIQUE PRISM OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING EARLY MARTIAN ENVIRONMENT.  ULTIMATELY  IT PRODUCES GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE TO RESEARCH  WHAT TO SEARCH FOR  AND HOW TO SEARCH.THE RESEARCH PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THE SI TEAM IS TIMELY  NEEDED  AND WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT A DECADE OF SEARCHES FOR LIFE ON MARS THAT MAY CULMINATE WITH A MARS SAMPLE RETURN MISSION.SCIENTIFICALLY  WE WILL CHARACTERIZE TERRESTRIAL ANALOGS TO ENVIRONMENTS AND BIOGEOMATERIALS CONSIDERED OF HIGH-PRIORITY TO THE SEARCH FOR TRACES OF ANCIENT LIFE ON MARS  AND WILL INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGING EARLY MARS CONDITIONS ON THE PRESERVATION OF BIOSIGNATURES.  INVESTIGATING THE PHYSICAL  BIMOLECULAR  AND METABOLIC RECORDS OF LIFE IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS  OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL DEFINE THEIR HABITABILITY POTENTIAL  TAPHONOMIC WINDOWS  POTENTIAL FOR BIOSIGNATURES AND THEIR PRESERVATION POTENTIAL.EXCELLENCE IN ASTROBIOLOGY  MARS TAPHONOMY  WORLD-CLASS LEADERSHIP IN THE EXPLORATION OF MARS ANALOGS  DEEP INVOLVEMENT IN MARS MISSIONS AND PROGRAMMATIC DECISIONS  AND ACCESS TO EXCEPTIONAL FIELD  LABORATORY AND INSTRUMENT ASSETS UNIQUELY POSITION THE SI TEAM TO BRING TO THE NAI THE MEANS OF PROVIDING CRITICAL EXPLORATION GUIDELINES TO SUPPORT THE SEARCH FOR LIFE THE MARS.",NON,12,B,2,,2017-07-20 00:00:00

LIFE WOULD COLLECT SAMPLES ONTO A SUB-MICRON FILTER AND ANALYZE THEM USING FLUORESCENCE IMAGING WITH SUB-MICRON SPATIAL RESOLUTIONS ENABLING THE DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION OF BACTERIUM-SIZED STRUCTURES.THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO ADVANCE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOLID-STATE NANOPORE INSTRUMENT (SEQLOW) FOR THE DETECTION AND STUDY OF A BROAD RANGE OF MICROBIAL BIOMARKERS IN OCEAN WORLD ENVIRONMENTS  SUCH AS EUROPA. THE SEQLOW INSTRUMENT WOULD USE A SOLID-STATE NANOPORE MEMBRANE PLATFORM DESIGNED FOR THE DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYIONIC ORGANIC POLYMERS DERIVED FROM MICROBIAL LIFE. THESE COULD INCLUDE TERRESTRIAL-LIKE DNA NUCLEOTIDES BUT ALSO NOVEL LINEAR POLYMERS THAT COULD INDICATE LIFE (SUCH AS TNAS AND XNAS).HERITAGE FOR THE PROPOSED INSTRUMENT WOULD BE DERIVED FROM A COMMERCIAL PORTABLE DNA-SEQUENCING PLATFORM (OXFORD NANOPORE'S MINION)  ALREADY USED FOR IN SITU FIELD ANALYSIS ON EARTH AND SLATED FOR INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TESTING. THE INTEGRITY OF THE CURRENT MINION PROTEIN NANOPORE MEMBRANE WOULD BE MADE MORE ROBUST TO SURVIVE LONG DURATION SPACE MISSIONS AS PART OF THIS PROPOSED WORK. THE SEQLOW INSTRUMENT WOULD CONTAIN DIFFERING PORE DIAMETERS FOR DETECTION OF MULTIPLE TYPES OF BIOMARKERS (I.E. DNA  CHARGED PROTEINS  AMINO ACIDS  VIRUSES ETC.)

DISCOVERY OF VOLATILE ORGANICS AND PERHAPS LIFE ON MARS IS UNLIKELY WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ACCESS TO THE SUBSURFACE. MANY OF THE GOALS OF NASA'S PLANETARY SCIENCE PROGRAM REQUIRE MOBILE SURVEYS SAMPLING DRY OR ICE-BEARING REGOLITH OR BEDROCK AND SAMPLE TRANSFER TO INSTRUMENTS. SEVERAL FUTURE PLANETARY EXPLORATION MISSIONS CALL FOR THIS INCLUDING THE PROPOSED EXOMARS ROVER IN 2018. LIGHT SPEED DELAYS FOR MARS MISSIONS (TENS OF MINUTES) ARE MUCH LONGER THAN THE TIME REQUIRED (SECONDS) TO GET A DRILL STUCK  SO DEEP SPACE ROVER DRILLING OPERATIONS MUST BE AUTOMATED AND FAIL-SAFE  OR ELSE RISK ANCHORING THE ROVER. OBTAINING SUBSURFACE SAMPLES OF REGOLITH WILL REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY A SUITABLE LOCATION  TRANSPORT AND EMPLACE A DRILLING APPARATUS  AND CONTROL THE OPERATION WITH HIGH RELIABILITY.  WE PROPOSE A MARS ROVER ANALOG MISSION AS A HIGH FIDELITY FIELD TEST OF AN INTEGRATED ROVER-DRILL SYSTEM WITH PROTOTYPE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE THEMSELVES FLIGHT MISSION CANDIDATES. DEPTH AND SAMPLE VOLUME REQUIREMENTS FOR SCIENTIFIC SAMPLE ACQUISITION IMPOSE THE NEED FOR A DRILL CAPABLE OF PENETRATING DEPTHS OF A METER OR GREATER. OBSERVING THE OPERATION OF THE ROVER/DRILLING SYSTEM IN A HIGH FIDELITY ENVIRONMENT ILLUMINATE THE DIFFICULT ISSUES OF LOW-GRAVITY DRILLING INTO AN UNKNOWN SUBSTRATE  DRILL SITE SENSING AND SELECTION  AND DRILL SYSTEM EMPLACEMENT AND STABILIZATION.  THE EXISTING ICEBREAKER-3 ROTARY-PERCUSSIVE DRILL SYSTEM (DERIVED ITSELF FROM THE PRIOR LIFE IN THE ATACAMA (LITA) ASTEP DRILL)  AND A NEW AUTONOMOUS MID-SIZED ROVER CONCEPT DEVELOPED BY NASA-AMES (DEVELOPED WITH SUPPORT FROM NASA EXPLORATION SYSTEMS)  ARE AVAILABLE AND COMPATIBLE FOR THE INTEGRATION REQUIRED FOR AN ANALOG SITE FIELD EXPERIMENT.   THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS TO THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENT ARE: 1) USE OF INTEGRATED DRILL AND ROVER AT SITES IN THE ATACAMA DESERT IN CHILE IN UNPREPARED ""REGOLITH""; 2) FIELD USE OF INSTRUMENTS WITH THE ROVER/DRILL THAT ARE FLIGHT PROTOTYPES COMPARABLE TO THOSE PLANNED FOR EXOMARS; 3) ACQUIRE DRILLED CUTTINGS AND TRANSFER TO INSTRUMENTS; 4) ON-BOARD AUTONOMY AND MONITORING TO SUPPORT DRILLING; FLIGHT-LIKE MISSION AND SCIENCE SUPPORT (OPERATIONS AND CONTROL) FOR THE ROVER/DRILL/INSTRUMENT OPERATIONS.    THE MOTIVATING GOAL BEHIND THE MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM IS THE SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE OF LIFE (E.G. MEPAG  DECADAL SURVEY  ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP). THE COLD AND DRY CONDITIONS ON MARS OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT EVIDENCE FOR LIFE MAY BE WELL PRESERVED IN THE FORM OF ORGANIC BIOMARKERS. EVEN WITHOUT BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTION  ORGANICS SHOULD STILL BE PRESENT ON MARS DUE TO THE FLUX OF ORGANIC BEARING METEORITIC MATERIAL (BENNER ET AL.  2000).  THREE MISSIONS HAVE TRIED TO DETECT ORGANICS ON MARS: MSL  THE PYROLYSIS GCMS ON VIKING (BIEMAN ET AL. 1979) AND THE TEGA ON PHOENIX (BOYNTON ET AL. 2009). IN ALL PRIOR INSTANCES THE SOIL SAMPLES WERE HEATED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES TO CAUSE VAPORIZATION OF ORGANICS ALLOWING DETECTION. THE PHOENIX DISCOVERY OF PERCHLORATES IN THE SOIL (HECHT ET AL. 2009) SUGGESTS STRONG OXIDANTS INCLUDING PERCHLORATE CAUSED ORGANIC OXIDATION TO CO2 PRIOR TO DETECTION. A REANALYSIS OF VIKING RESULTS (NAVARRO-GONZALEZ ET AL.  2010) SUGGEST THAT ~0.1% PERCHLORATES AND A FEW PPM OF ORGANICS WERE PRESENT AT THE VIKING LANDING SITES.  IN SUMMARY  GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF PERCHLORATE IN THE SURFACE SOIL  AND THE CHEMICAL REACTIVITY OF THE UPPER SOIL LAYERS  METHODS ARE NEEDED THAT CAN DETECT ORGANIC MATERIALS IN SAMPLES COLLECTED BELOW THE ZONE OF ACTIVE OXIDATION (BULLOCK ET AL. 2004)  AT THE SUBPPM LEVEL AND IN THE PRESENCE OF PERCHLORATE. THE PROPOSED ARADS ROVER/DRILL COMBINATION  OPERATING ON THE PERCHLORATE-BEARING DESICCATED SOILS OF THE ATACAMA ANALOG SITE  WILL PROVIDE HIGH-FIDELITY SAMPLE COLLECTION AND SCIENCE OPPORTUNITIES TO TEST THESE DETECTION METHODS.",NON,12,B,2,,2017-05-05 00:00:00

WE HAVE GAINED PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE INSIGHT INTO PROCESSES INSIDE THE EARTH CRUST AND AT THE EARTH SURFACE. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT ROCKS UNDER STRESS TURN INTO ABATTERY FROM WHERE ELECTRONIC CHARGE CARRIERS CAN FLOW OUT  WHICH CAN PROPAGATE OVER LONG DISTANCES. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE CHARGE CARRIERS CONSIST OF ELECTRONS AND DEFECT ELECTRONS  ALSO KNOWN AS POSITIVE HOLES  AND THAT THE POSITIVE HOLES PROPAGATE THROUGH THE ROCKS TO THE SURFACE WHERE THEY RECOMBINE  GIVING RISE TO AN INCREASE IN GRAYBODY THERMAL IR EMISSION PLUS BROAD-BAND NON-THERMAL IREMISSION DETECTABLE FROM SATELLITES. IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK WE GAINED INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC (ELF/ULF) SIGNALS ARE GENERATED. WE DISCOVERED AIR IONIZATION AT THE EARTH SURFACE  WHICH IS A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR PRE-EARTHQUAKE IONOSPHERIC PERTURBATIONS. WE DISCOVERED CHANGES IN GROUND AND SPRING WATER CHEMISTRY WHEN POSITIVE HOLES CROSS THEROCK-WATER INTERFACE.  BY FORMULATING FOR THE FIRST TIME A UNIFIED THEORY OF PRE-EARTHQUAKE PHENOMENA  OUR WORK CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERARCHING ESI GOAL TO ASSESS  MITIGATE AND FORECAST NATURAL HAZARDS THAT AFFECT SOCIETY.

IN THIS FOLLOW-ON PROPOSAL WE PROPOSE A BROAD EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO CLARIFY A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THECOURSE OF THE PRIOR WORK:  (I) WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE SHORT EM PULSES  WHICH ARE EMITTED IN INCREASING NUMBERS FROM WITHIN THE EARTH BEFORE EARTHQUAKES OCCUR?(II) WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE SURFACE PROCESSES  SPECIFICALLY THE EMISSION OF ELECTRONICALLY EXCITED O ATOMS  THE FORMATION OF OZONE DURING CORONA DISCHARGES  AND THE OBSERVED CHANGES IN RADAR REFLECTIVITY?  MANY STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY PARTICIPATED IN THE PAST WORK (NASA AMES E/PO PROGRAMS  NASA ACADEMY  NSF-REU PROGRAMS AT SJSU AND THE SETI INSTITUTE  COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS WITH UK). ALL HAVE BECOME CO-AUTHORS ON PAPERS PRESENTED AT CONFERENCES ANDPUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS. HESE E/PO ACTIVITIES WILL CONTINUE DURING THIS PROPOSAL.

IT CURRENTLY POSSESSES A SIGNIFICANT GLOBALLY EXTANT ATMOSPHERE THAT SHARES ITS COMPOSITION WITH N2 RICH VOLATILE SURFACE ICES  AND THE TWO ARE ASSUMED TO BE IN VAPOR PRESSURE EQUILIBRIUM. STELLAR OCCULTATIONS HAVE REVEALED AN APPARENT DOUBLING IN ATMOSPHERIC MASS SINCE PERIHELION IN 1989 ELLIOT ET AL. 2003  SICARDY ET AL. 2003  PASACHOFF ET AL. 2005  WHICH IS LIKELY DUE TO INCREASED SURFACE TEMPERATURE DRIVING AN INCREASE IN VAPOR PRESSURE BUT WHY AND HOW WAS THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE STILL INCREASING MORE THAN 10 EARTH YEARS AFTER PERIHELION? PLUTOS GREATLY ELONGATED ORBIT SUBJECTS IT TO LARGE SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF INCOMING SOLAR ENERGY  POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN ATMOSPHERIC COLLAPSE NEAR APHELION NEXT IN 2112.ITS ICY SURFACE EXHIBITS AN ALBEDO FIELD THAT IS COMPLEX EVEN AT LARGE SCALES AND IS KNOWN TO BE CAPABLE OF CHANGING QUICKLY AND MARKEDLY STERN ET AL. 1997  BUIE ET AL. 2010.WHILE THE BULK  LONG TERM CHANGE IN GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC MASS CAN BE EXPLAINED USING SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS ALONE HANSEN AND PAIGE 1996  SUCH MODELS ARE NOT ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE DETAILS REVEALED IN INCREASINGLY RICH OBSERVATIONAL DATA SETS. THE FULLARRAY OF MECHANISMS PRODUCING PLUTOS DYNAMIC DISPLAYS REMAIN A MYSTERY. HOWEVER  THE ATMOSPHERE MAY BE MUCH MORE THAN MERELY A PASSIVE PLAYER IN THE GLOBAL ENERGY AND VOLATILE MASS CYCLES. INITIAL GENERAL CIRCULATION MODEL GCM STUDIES USING SIMPLIFIED APPROXIMATIONS OF PHYSICAL PROCESSES SUGGEST STRONG AND ROBUST CIRCULATIONS IN PLUTOS ATMOSPHERE  INCLUDING HIGHSPEED  HIGH ALTITUDE POLAR JETS ZALUCHA AND GULBIS 2011. THEREFORE  THE STRONG VAPOR PRESSURE COUPLING BETWEEN PLUTOS ATMOSPHERE AND SURFACE SUGGESTS THAT FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT OF ENERGY AND VOLATILE MASS BEYOND THAT ASSUMED BY HANSEN AND PAIGE 1996 HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MORE ACCURATELY EXPLAIN AND RESOLVE INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN EXTANT VOLATILE CYCLE MODELS AND OBSERVATIONS. THE WORK PROPOSED HEREIN WOULD DIRECTLY INVESTIGATE THE GLOBAL CHARACTER OF PLUTOS ATMOSPHERE AND ITS TWO WAY FEEDBACKS WITH N2 ICE ON THE SURFACE BY COMBINING A STATE OF THE ART THREE DIMENSIONAL ATMOSPHERIC MODEL WITH A DETAILEDSURFACE AND SUBSURFACE THERMAL MODEL.SCIENCE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH1 DESCRIBE THE LOWER ATMOSPHERES LARGE SCALE CIRCULATION AND SURFACE PRESSURE STRUCTURE AND ITS ROLES IN THE EVOLUTION OF PLUTOS VOLATILE SURFACE N2 ICE  WITHIN THE CURRENT OBSERVATIONAL ERA 1985 2015.2 DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS MODIFY THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE'S LARGE SCALE CIRCULATION AND SURFACE PRESSURE STRUCTURE  WITHIN THE CURRENT OBSERVATIONAL ERA 1985 2015.3 CHARACTERIZE THE POTENTIAL LONGER TERM EVOLUTION OF PLUTOS SURFACE N2 ICE DISTRIBUTION  LOWERATMOSPHERIC LARGE SCALE CIRCULATION  AND SURFACE PRESSURE STRUCTURE FROM NEAR PERIHELION TOWARDS APHELION 2015 2045 TO ASSIST PLANNING OF FUTURE OBSERVATIONS.KEY QUESTIONS TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE PROPOSED RESEARCHA ATMOSPHERIC ROLE IN SURFACE CHARACTER  AND VICE VERSA: IN WHAT WAYS DO LARGE SCALE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATIONS IMPACT THE OTHERWISE AXISYMMETRIC FLUX OF VOLATILE MATERIALS TO SURFACE DEPOSITION REGIONS? IN WHAT WAYS DOES THE ATMOSPHERE CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE  NATURE  ANDPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF N2 ICE ACROSS PLUTO? IN WHAT WAYS DO THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF ALBEDO  EMISSIVITY  AND OTHER SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS AFFECT THE ATMOSPHERE?B ATMOSPHERIC CHARACTER WHAT IS THE THERMAL STRUCTURE AND SURFACE PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE  AND WHAT ROLE DO ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS PLAY IN MAINTAINING THEM?

ADDITIONAL SENSITIVITY CAN BE OBTAINED BY USE OF MULTIPHOTON DETECTION  SCREENING OUT BACKGROUND EVENTS AND DETECTING [125JI AT BELOW BACKGROUND LEVELS.

THERE IS AN INCREASING NEED FOR HIGHLY ACCURATE ROVIBRATIONAL LINE LISTS INCLUDING INFRARED INTENSITIES OF SMALL MOLECULES THAT ARE COMMON IN VARIOUS ASTROPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES. THIS IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE AVAILABILITY OF EVER INCREASINGLY HIGH RESOLUTION TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS  INCLUDING SPACE BASED SUCH AS  HERSCHEL AND  JWST   PLANE BASED  SUCH  AS  SOFIA  AND GROUND  BASED  SUCH  AS  ALMA. FURTHER  FOR MANY OF THE MOLECULES OF INTEREST  THE LINE LISTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPAN A LARGE TEMPERATURE RANGE SINCE THEY EXISTS IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS THAT SPAN A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE. ONE SUCH MOLECULE IS S02  WHICH WAS CLASSIFIED AS ONE OF NINE ""WEED"" MOLECULES BY THE HIFI COMMUNITY. ADDITIONALLY  IT COMMONLY OCCURS ON PLANETS OR MOONS THAT EXHIBIT VOLCANIC ACTIVITY  AND THUS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC MOLECULE IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES FOR EXAMPLE  S02 COMPOSES ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF JUPITER'S MOON IO  AND JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WAS FOUND TO BE PROMINENT IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE OF VENUS. WE PROPOSE  TO  USE  A  COMBINATION  OF  THEORY  AND  HIGH RESOLUTION  EXPERIMENTS  TO  DETERMINE  A  HIGHLY  ACCURATE ROVIBRATIONAL LINE LIST FOR S02 AND ITS ISOTOPOLOGUES THAT WILL BE ACCURATE TO VERY HIGH J VALUES  UP TO J EQUAL200 AND UP TO 20 000 CM L ABOVE THE ZERO POINT LEVEL. THROUGH THE USE OF HIGH ACCURACY ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS  AND  REFINEMENT  OF  THE RESULTING  POTENTIAL  ENERGY  SURFACE PES WITH  THE  AVAILABLE  EXPERIMENTAL  DATA   THIS APPROACH HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO GENERATE HIGHLY ACCURATE LINE LISTS FOR ISOTOPOLOGUES OF THE WATER MOLECULE  THE AMMONIA MOLECULE  AND MOST RECENTLY CARBON DIOXIDE. FOR ALL THREE  THE ACCURACY OF THE RESULTING PES  TRANSITION ENERGIES  AND INTENSITIES HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY LATER HIGH RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPIC STUDIES. WE HAVE COMPLETED AN INITIAL LINE LIST FOR 32SL602  THOUGH THERE IS FURTHER REFINEMENT NEEDED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY AND EXTEND IT TO HIGHER J VALUES. FURTHER  ONCE A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE LINE LIST HAS BEEN  DETERMINED FOR 32SL602  THIS WILL BE EXTENDED TO ITS ISOTOPOLOGUES  INCLUDING 34SL602  32SL60L80  32SL802  34SL60L80  AND 34SL802. FURTHER  WE PROPOSE TO GO BEYOND WEEDING SPECTRA AND DEVELOP ROBUST STATE OF THE ART THEORETICAL SPECTROSCOPY METHODS TO GENERATE LIMITED LINE LISTS FOR SMALL TRANSIENT MOLECULES FOR WHICH THERE IS LITTLE OR NO EXPERIMENTAL DATA AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO AID ASTRONOMERS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE MANY AS YET UNASSIGNED LINES IN HIFI SPECTRA AND THAT WILL BE FOUND WITH THE GREAT AND EXES INSTRUMENTS ON SOFIA. LINE LISTS FOR THESE MOLECULES WILL BE LIMITED TO PURELY ROTATIONAL TRANSITIONS AS WELL AS THE ROVIBRATIONAL BANDS OF ALL FUNDAMENTALS. INITIALLY  WE WILL TARGET THE LIMITED LINE LIST STUDIES ON THE NH4  H2CL AND H20 MOLECULAR CATIONS. THESE HIGHLY ACCURATE LINE LISTS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE ASTRONOMY AND EXOPLANET COMMUNITIES  FOR USE  IN ANALYZING DATA FROM HERSCHEL AND SOFIA  AMONG OTHER NASA MISSIONS  AND GROUND BASED TELESCOPES SUCH AS ALMA.",NON,12,B,2,,2017-03-20 00:00:00

OUR METHOD ALLOWS US TO IGNORE THE COMPLEX EVOLUTION OF A MOON'S MEAN MOTION (MOST OF SATURN'S MOONS HAVE THEIR MEAN MOTIONS PERTURBED IN SOME WAY) AND INSTEAD TO FOCUS ON THE SHORT-PERIOD ROTATIONAL LIBRATIONS  WHICH ARE THE MODES THAT POTENTIALLY YIELD INSIGHTS INTO THE MOON'S GEOPHYSICS. USING THIS METHOD  TISCARENO ET AL. (2009) MEASURED A PHYSICAL LIBRATION OF 5.9 +- 1.2 DEGREES IN THE ROTATION OF EPIMETHEUS  CONFIRMING THAT EPIMETHEUS' INTERIOR IS EITHER HOMOGENEOUS IN DENSITY OR ONLY MODESTLY DIFFERENTIATED. WE ALSO APPLIED OUR METHOD TO HELENE  PALLENE  METHONE  AND ANTHE (THOMAS ET AL. 2013). WE HERE PROPOSE TO EXTEND THIS SUCCESSFUL ANALYSIS TO ENCELADUS. ENCELADUS HAS RECEIVED SPECIAL ATTENTION DUE TO THE VAPOR-SPEWING VENTS IN ITS SOUTH POLAR REGION AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT EITHER A GLOBAL OR REGIONAL OCEAN UNDERLIES THE ICY SURFACE. MEASURING A ROTATIONAL LIBRATION FOR ENCELADUS  OR EVEN PUTTING A MORE ROBUST UPPER LIMIT ON IT  WOULD HELP TO CONSTRAIN ITS MOMENTS OF INERTIA  WHICH CURRENTLY ARE POORLY KNOWN (GAO AND STEVENSON 2013)  AND WOULD LIKELY REVEAL THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A SUBSURFACE OCEAN. WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE ORIENTATION OF ENCELADUS  USING OUR EXISTING CONTROL-POINT NETWORK (BASED ON CASSINI IMAGES) AND OUR PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED DYNAMICAL APPARATUS. WE WILL ASSIST IN DEVELOPING AN AUTOMATED IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROCESS IN ORDER TO USE A MONTE CARLO METHOD TO PROVIDE A ROBUST ESTIMATE OF THE UNCERTAINTY FOR THE PARAMETERS (E.G.  LIBRATION AMPLITUDE) THAT GOVERN THE DYNAMICAL MODELS.

IN MANY INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS  THE HIGH-LYING ISOMER HYDROGEN ISOCYANIDE (HNC)  IS OFTEN FOUND TO BE AS ABUNDANT AS HCN. MODELS HAVE SHOWN THAT INCLUDING HCN MAY ALTER THE OPACITY OF A PLANETARY ATMOSPHERE BY ONE OR TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. ALSO HNC MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE OPACITY OF HCN CONTAINING OBJECTS. CONSIDERING THAT HCN HAS BEEN FOUND IN HOT-JUPITER EXOPLANETS  AND THE FIRST SUPER-EARTH EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERE DETECTION OF 55 CANCRI E ALSO HINTS AT THE PRESENCE OF HCN  A HIGHLY ACCURATE AND COMPLETE HCN/HNC LINE LIST THAT PERFORMS UP TO 2000-3000K IS NEEDED. THE LINE LIST WILL HELP ASTRONOMERS TO ANALYZE AND SIMULATE THE EXOPLANET SPECTROSCOPIC DATA MORE ACCURATELY AND RELIABLY DETERMINE THEIR ATMOSPHERE CONDITIONS  WHICH WILL ENABLE FUTURE PLANETARY SCIENCE STUDIES. THE CURRENT HITRAN DATABASE HAS ONLY ~3000 TRANSITIONS UP TO 3400 CM-1 FOR HCN  AND ~600 TRANSITIONS FOR ITS 13C OR 15N ISOTOPOLOGUES. THE EXOMOL HCN/HNC LINE LIST (BARBER R.J. MNRAS 2014  437  1828) WAS UPGRADED FROM AN AB INITIO COMPUTATIONAL LINE LIST WHERE ~168 000 LEVELS WERE REPLACED BY EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED VALUES AND PREDICTIONS. WITH BAND ORIGINS CORRECTED  THE ORIGINAL LEVELS WERE STILL OFF BY ~1 CM-1  OTHERWISE IT COULD BE DOZENS OF CM-1 FOR THE HIGH-LYING STATES. THE MODEL BASED PREDICTIONS PROBABLY DIVERGE AT HIGH J'S. THE 3~4% UNCERTAINTY OF THE ENERGY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HCN / HNC MINIMA MAY LEAD TO ~10% OPACITY VARIATION AT HIGH TEMPERATURE. THE AB INITIO INTENSITY WILL BE LESS RELIABLE FOR THE HIGHER ENERGY REGION  WEAK BANDS  AND HOT BANDS. ALL THESE WILL AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF DATA ANALYSIS. IN ADDITION  THE LINE LISTS OF D  13C  15N RELATED ISOTOPOLOGUES ARE MUCH FURTHER FROM COMPLETENESS. IN SHORT  THE LATEST EXOMOL LINE LIST IS NOT REALLY SUITABLE FOR HIGH ENERGY AND ESPECIALLY HIGH TEMPERATURE STUDIES OF PLANETARY AND EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES. WE PROPOSE TO COMPUTE A SELF-CONSISTENT  HIGHLY ACCURATE&COMPLETE IR LINE LIST FOR THE HCN/HNC SYSTEM AND ITS ISOTOPOLGOUES. THE  BEST THEORY + HIGH-RESOLUTION EXPT DATA  STRATEGY WAS ADOPTED OVER THE LAST DECADE FOR THE BEST AVAILABLE IR LINE LISTS OF CO2 AND SO2  WHERE EXACT QUANTUM ROVIBRATIONAL HAMILTONIAN CALCULATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT TO REFINE AN AB INITIO PES WITH SELECTED EXPERIMENTAL DATA. THE SUPERIORITY OF THIS STRATEGY IS FOR PREDICTIONS! IN ADDITION TO REPRODUCING MOST EXISTING MEASURED TRANSITIONS WITH 0.01 - 0.02 CM-1 AND 2-10% INTENSITY DEVIATIONS  WE CAN MAKE PREDICTIONS WITH SIMILAR ACCURACY. PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED BY MANY RECENT EXPERIMENTS: OUR SO2 LINE LISTS MATCH LINE-BY-LINE TO THE IR PEAKS OBSERVED IN THE LAB; OUR CO2 LISTS BASED IR SIMULATIONS ARE BETTER THAN HITEMP WHEN COMPARED WITH 1550K AND 1773K SPECTRA. COMPARED TO DATABASES HITRAN  GEISA AND CDSD ETC. OUR LISTS ARE FAR MORE COMPLETE  MORE SELF-CONSISTENT  AND MORE RELIABLE WHEN EXTRAPOLATED TO HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND A HIGHER ENERGY RANGE. WE CAN ALSO GENERATE ISOTOPOLOGUE LINE LISTS WITH SIMILAR ACCURACY  E.G. THE AMES IR LISTS FOR 13 CO2 ISOTOPOLOGUES ARE ACCURATE UP TO 18 000 CM-1 AND 1500K  WHICH ARE THE MOST COMPLETE AND RELIABLE CO2 IR LISTS FOR HOT-JUPITER LIKE EXOPLANETS. BY ADOPTING THIS PROVEN STRATEGY AND USING THE LATEST EXPERIMENTAL INFORMATION  WE EXPECT THE NEW HCN/HNC LISTS TO HAVE SIMILAR QUALITY AND RANGE AS WE HAVE ACHIEVED FOR CO2 AND SO2  I.E. WORKING UP TO 2000K OR HIGHER. THE NEW LINE LISTS WILL BE DEPOSITED ONTO THE NASA PDS OR HITRAN DATABASE.THIS STUDY RESPONDS TO THE CALL OF PLANETARY DATA ARCHIVING  RESTORATION  AND TOOLS  SEC.1.5 ""GENERATION OF NEW REFERENCE INFORMATION  AS THE PROPOSED HCN/HNC LINE LISTS IS INTENDED FOR GENERAL USE IN PLANETARY (ATMOSPHERE) SCIENCE.",NON,12,A,2,,2017-06-20 00:00:00

OBSERVING THE OPERATION OF THE ROVER/DRILLING SYSTEM IN A HIGH FIDELITY ENVIRONMENT ILLUMINATE THE DIFFICULT ISSUES OF LOW-GRAVITY DRILLING INTO AN UNKNOWN SUBSTRATE  DRILL SITE SENSING AND SELECTION  AND DRILL SYSTEM EMPLACEMENT AND STABILIZATION.THE EXISTING ICEBREAKER-3 ROTARY-PERCUSSIVE DRILL SYSTEM (DERIVED ITSELF FROM THE PRIOR LIFE IN THE ATACAMA (LITA) ASTEP DRILL)  AND A NEW AUTONOMOUS MID-SIZED ROVER CONCEPT DEVELOPED BY NASA-AMES (DEVELOPED WITH SUPPORT FROM NASA EXPLORATION SYSTEMS)  ARE AVAILABLE AND COMPATIBLE FOR THE INTEGRATION REQUIRED FOR AN ANALOG SITE FIELD EXPERIMENT.   THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS TO THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENT ARE: 1) USE OF INTEGRATED DRILL AND ROVER AT SITES IN THE ATACAMA DESERT IN CHILE IN UNPREPARED ""REGOLITH""; 2) FIELD USE OF INSTRUMENTS WITH THE ROVER/DRILL THAT ARE FLIGHT PROTOTYPES COMPARABLE TO THOSE PLANNED FOR EXOMARS; 3) ACQUIRE DRILLED CUTTINGS AND TRANSFER TO INSTRUMENTS; 4) ON-BOARD AUTONOMY AND MONITORING TO SUPPORT DRILLING; FLIGHT-LIKE MISSION AND SCIENCE SUPPORT (OPERATIONS AND CONTROL) FOR THE ROVER/DRILL/INSTRUMENT OPERATIONS.  THE MOTIVATING GOAL BEHIND THE MARS EXPLORATION PROGRAM IS THE SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE OF LIFE (E.G. MEPAG  DECADAL SURVEY  ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP). THE COLD AND DRY CONDITIONS ON MARS OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT EVIDENCE FOR LIFE MAY BE WELL PRESERVED IN THE FORM OF ORGANIC BIOMARKERS. EVEN WITHOUT BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTION  ORGANICS SHOULD STILL BE PRESENT ON MARS DUE TO THE FLUX OF ORGANIC BEARING METEORITIC MATERIAL (BENNER ET AL.  2000).  THREE MISSIONS HAVE TRIED TO DETECT ORGANICS ON MARS: MSL  THE PYROLYSIS GCMS ON VIKING (BIEMAN ET AL. 1979) AND THE TEGA ON PHOENIX (BOYNTON ET AL. 2009). IN ALL PRIOR INSTANCES THE SOIL SAMPLES WERE HEATED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES TO CAUSE VAPORIZATION OF ORGANICS ALLOWING DETECTION. THE PHOENIX DISCOVERY OF PERCHLORATES IN THE SOIL (HECHT ET AL. 2009) SUGGESTS STRONG OXIDANTS INCLUDING PERCHLORATE CAUSED ORGANIC OXIDATION TO CO2 PRIOR TO DETECTION. A REANALYSIS OF VIKING RESULTS (NAVARRO-GONZALEZ ET AL.  2010) SUGGEST THAT ~0.1% PERCHLORATES AND A FEW PPM OF ORGANICS WERE PRESENT AT THE VIKING LANDING SITES.IN SUMMARY  GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF PERCHLORATE IN THE SURFACE SOIL  AND THE CHEMICAL REACTIVITY OF THE UPPER SOIL LAYERS  METHODS ARE NEEDED THAT CAN DETECT ORGANIC MATERIALS IN SAMPLES COLLECTED BELOW THE ZONE OF ACTIVE OXIDATION (BULLOCK ET AL. 2004)  AT THE SUBPPM LEVEL AND IN THE PRESENCE OF PERCHLORATE. THE PROPOSED ARADS ROVER/DRILL COMBINATION  OPERATING ON THE PERCHLORATE-BEARING DESICCATED SOILS OF THE ATACAMA ANALOG SITE  WILL PROVIDE HIGH-FIDELITY SAMPLE COLLECTION AND SCIENCE OPPORTUNITIES TO TEST THESE DETECTION METHODS.",NON,12,B,2,,2017-04-20 00:00:00

SOME TYPES OF MEMBRANE LIPIDS ARE FOUND ONLY IN SPECIFIC  GROUPS OF ORGANISMS  AND HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN USED AS BIOMARKERS FOR THESE GROUPS. THE CARBON  SKELETONS OF BRANCHED OR CYCLIC LIPIDS ARE MORE RESISTANT TO DEGRADATION AFTER CELL DEATH AND CAN  SURVIVE IN THE ROCK RECORD FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS. SUCH  GEOLIPIDS  PROVIDE IMPORTANT FOSSIL  INFORMATION AND CAN HELP RECONSTRUCT THE RECORD OF PAST MICROBIAL ECOSYSTEMS ON THE EARLY EARTH   AND POTENTIALLY OTHER PLANETARY BODIES.  PREVIOUS LIPID BIOMARKER WORK HAS LARGELY BEEN DIRECTED AT ESTABLISHING TAXONOMIC PROXIES BY  IDENTIFYING COMPOUNDS IN PURE CULTURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES. BUT RECENT MOLECULAR WORK  IDENTIFYING THE GENES INVOLVED IN THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF GEOLOGICALLY RELEVANT LIPIDS SUCH AS  HOPANOIDS HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO SURVEYING GENOMIC AND METAGENOMIC DATA SETS FOR THE ABILITY TO  SYNTHESIZE THESE COMPOUNDS. THIS WORK HAS REVEALED A MUCH BROADER DISTRIBUTION OF THE GENES THAN  WAS PREVIOUSLY REALIZED VIA THE PURE CULTURE STUDIES. THIS DISCOVERY HAS NECESSITATED A SHIFT FROM  TAXONOMIC STUDIES TO INVESTIGATING THE CELLULAR FUNCTION OF THESE COMPOUNDS. THE GOAL IS TO LINK  THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF THE LIPID BIOMARKERS TO SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR  BIO(GEO)CHEMICAL PROCESSES. SUCH A RELATIONSHIP WILL OFFER NEW CRITERIA FOR INTERPRETING THE ROCK  RECORD.  IN KEEPING WITH THE DISCOVERY OF THE WIDER DISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN LIPID BIOMARKERS  WE HAVE  RECENTLY FOUND THAT THREE PURPLE NON-SULFUR (PNS) ANOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHS ISOLATED FROM MARINE   HYPERSALINE  AND HOT SPRING ENVIRONMENTS SYNTHESIZE 3- METHYLBACTERIOHOPANEPOLYOLS (3-MEBHPS). THESE COMPOUNDS WERE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE EXCLUSIVELY  MADE BY OXYGEN-REQUIRING METHANOTROPHIC AND ACETIC ACID BACTERIA  AND HAVE LONG BEEN CONSIDERED A  SIGNAL FOR METHANOTROPHY IN THE ROCK RECORD. HOWEVER  OUR CULTURES ARE THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF BOTH  THE PRODUCTION OF 3-MEBHPS BY PHOTOTROPHIC BACTERIA AND THEIR PRODUCTION UNDER ANOXIC CONDITIONS.  WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE CELLULAR FUNCTION OF THESE COMPOUNDS IN PNS BY UTILIZING A NOVEL  COMBINATION OF MOLECULAR GENETICS  LABORATORY CULTURE  AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES. THE GOAL IS TO  LINK THE LABORATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERIMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE OBSERVATIONS MADE WITH PURE  CULTURES REFLECT THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF 3-MEBHPS IN THE ENVIRONMENT. SUCH A RELATIONSHIP IS NECESSARY  FOR PROPERLY INTERPRETING THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE COMPOUNDS IN THE SEDIMENTARY ROCK RECORD.  PRELIMINARY PNS PURE CULTURE EXPERIMENTS HAVE REVEALED THAT BOTH TOTAL BHP AND 3-MEBHP INCREASED  RELATIVE TO TOTAL MEMBRANE FATTY ACID WITH INCREASING PH. WE ALSO OBSERVED A CONCOMITANT INCREASE  IN CYCLOPROPANE FATTY ACID (CY19)  INDICATING A MEMBRANE RESPONSE TO PH STRESS. WE PROPOSE TO  INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF HOPANOIDS IN PH HOMEOSTASIS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY IDENTIFYING THE  3-MEBHP BIOSYNTHESIS GENE (HPNR) IN THESE ORGANISMS  AND CREATING DELETION MUTANTS OF THIS GENE FOR  SUBSEQUENT PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES. THE AIM OF THESE STUDIES WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW 3-MEBHP  PRODUCTION IS REGULATED IN RESPONSE TO MEMBRANE STRESS. WE WILL ALSO PERFORM DETAILED  COMPOUND-SPECIFIC C ISOTOPIC STUDIES  AS PRELIMINARY ANALYSES INDICATE THAT THE PNS 3-MEBHPS WILL  BE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM METHANOTROPHIC 3-MEBHPS IN THE ROCK RECORD.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO THE EXOBIOLOGY THEME OF EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE AND THE  BIOSPHERE  AND OBJECTIVES (II) UNDERSTAND THE PHYLOGENY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF MICROORGANISMS  INCLUDING  EXTREMOPHILES  WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS MAY REFLECT THE NATURE OF PRIMITIVE ENVIRONMENTS; AND VI)  INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION OF GENES  PATHWAYS  AND MICROBIAL SPECIES SUBJECT TO LONG-TERM  ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE RELEVANT TO THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH AND THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE.,NON,M,D,2,,2017-12-22 16:56:46.772563

FOR EXAMPLE TRYING TO SURVIVE SUCH EVENTS AS A SNOWBALL EARTH. THESE ARE LIKELY TO BE HAVE BEEN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE LOW TEMPERATURES CAUSED ORGANISMS TO HAVE LOW RATES OF METABOLISM AND SUBSEQUENT DIFFICULTIES IN SYNTHESIZING DNA AND REPAIRING DAMAGE CAUSED BY BACKGROUND RADIATION.ONE OF THE LIMITING FACTORS IN THE SURVIVAL OF ""DORMANT"" ORGANISMS IS REPAIR OF DAMAGE TO VARIOUS LARGE MOLECULES  SUCH AS DNA. ALTHOUGH SUCH DAMAGE IS UNIVERSAL  A LOW DNA SYNTHESIS/REPAIR RATE DUE TO LOW METABOLIC ACTIVITY AT LOW TEMPERATURE LIMITS THE ABILITY OF AN ORGANISM TO RESPOND. IT HAD ONCE BEEN ASSUMED THAT MICROBES ARE NOT METABOLICALLY ACTIVE WHEN FROZEN AND ARE UNABLE TO REPAIR ANY DAMAGE THEY SUFFER BELOW THE FREEZING POINT OF WATER. MORE RECENT WORK HAS SHOWN THIS NOT TO BE TRUE.HOWEVER  IF SUCH ACTIVITY EXISTS  IT LIKELY EXISTS AT ONLY LOW LEVELS. TO UNDERSTAND LIFE IN SUCH ENVIRONMENTS  WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DETECT ACTIVITY THAT OCCURS AND UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN AFFECT SURVIVAL.RADIOLABELING OF DNA THROUGH INCORPORATION OF [125]I-5-IODO-2-DEOXYURIDINE ([125]IIDU)  IN PLACE OF THYMIDINE  CAN PROVIDE VERY HIGHLY SENSITIVE DETECTION OF DNA SYNTHESIS AND REPAIR  ESPECIALLY THROUGH HE USE OF MULTIPHOTON DETECTION. WE CAN USE THIS SENSITIVITY TO MEASURE CELLULAR METABOLISM AND REPAIR AT LOWER LEVELS BY OBSERVING THE INCORPORATION OF [125]I LABELED DEOXYURIDINE INTO DNA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WILL BE TO PUSH THE LOWER TEMPERATURE LIMIT AT WHICH METABOLIC ACTIVITY CAN BE DETECTED PAST THOSE PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED. OUR RESULTS WILL ALSO GIVE A DIRECT COMPARISON TO METHODS BASED ON [3]H AND [14]C LABELING METHODS. WE WILL ALSO STUDY HOW THE LOWER LIMITS OF TEMPERATURE AFFECTS THE VIABILITY OF OTHER MODEL ORGANISM AND HOW LOW TEMPERATURES AFFECT A THERMOPHILE THAT ENCOUNTERS TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW OPTIMAL GROWTH WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING A PHASE CHANGE.BY BETTER UNDERSTANDING LIFE ON THE EDGE OF HABITABILITY  WE WILL GAIN A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIMITS OF LIFE  THE ENVIRONMENTS THAT LIFE CAN EXIST IN  AND HOW LONG LIFE CAN EXIST IN DORMANT STATES. THIS WILL BETTER INFORM MISSION PLANNING ON WHERE LIFE MIGHT EXIST  GIVE A BETTER BASIS FOR THE FORMULATION OF LIFE DETECTION EXPERIMENTS  AND HELP FORMULATE MISSION STRATEGIES TO DETECT LIFE AND ITS INFLUENCES. IT CAN BE USED AS A TOOL FOR THE DETECTION OF ORGANISMS  IN THE SEARCH FOR LIFE AND IN PLANETARY PROTECTION. IT CAN LEAD TO FUTURE WORK TO STUDY HOW ORGANISMS SURVIVE PERIODS OF EXTREME CLIMATE.",NON,M,B,2,,2017-10-18 15:28:36.838697

SOME TYPES OF MEMBRANE LIPIDS ARE FOUND ONLY IN SPECIFIC  GROUPS OF ORGANISMS  AND HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN USED AS BIOMARKERS FOR THESE GROUPS. THE CARBON  SKELETONS OF BRANCHED OR CYCLIC LIPIDS ARE MORE RESISTANT TO DEGRADATION AFTER CELL DEATH AND CAN  SURVIVE IN THE ROCK RECORD FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS. SUCH  GEOLIPIDS  PROVIDE IMPORTANT FOSSIL  INFORMATION AND CAN HELP RECONSTRUCT THE RECORD OF PAST MICROBIAL ECOSYSTEMS ON THE EARLY EARTH   AND POTENTIALLY OTHER PLANETARY BODIES.  PREVIOUS LIPID BIOMARKER WORK HAS LARGELY BEEN DIRECTED AT ESTABLISHING TAXONOMIC PROXIES BY  IDENTIFYING COMPOUNDS IN PURE CULTURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES. BUT RECENT MOLECULAR WORK  IDENTIFYING THE GENES INVOLVED IN THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF GEOLOGICALLY RELEVANT LIPIDS SUCH AS  HOPANOIDS HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO SURVEYING GENOMIC AND METAGENOMIC DATA SETS FOR THE ABILITY TO  SYNTHESIZE THESE COMPOUNDS. THIS WORK HAS REVEALED A MUCH BROADER DISTRIBUTION OF THE GENES THAN  WAS PREVIOUSLY REALIZED VIA THE PURE CULTURE STUDIES. THIS DISCOVERY HAS NECESSITATED A SHIFT FROM  TAXONOMIC STUDIES TO INVESTIGATING THE CELLULAR FUNCTION OF THESE COMPOUNDS. THE GOAL IS TO LINK  THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF THE LIPID BIOMARKERS TO SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR  BIO(GEO)CHEMICAL PROCESSES. SUCH A RELATIONSHIP WILL OFFER NEW CRITERIA FOR INTERPRETING THE ROCK  RECORD.  IN KEEPING WITH THE DISCOVERY OF THE WIDER DISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN LIPID BIOMARKERS  WE HAVE  RECENTLY FOUND THAT THREE PURPLE NON-SULFUR (PNS) ANOXYGENIC PHOTOTROPHS ISOLATED FROM MARINE   HYPERSALINE  AND HOT SPRING ENVIRONMENTS SYNTHESIZE 3- METHYLBACTERIOHOPANEPOLYOLS (3-MEBHPS). THESE COMPOUNDS WERE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE EXCLUSIVELY  MADE BY OXYGEN-REQUIRING METHANOTROPHIC AND ACETIC ACID BACTERIA  AND HAVE LONG BEEN CONSIDERED A  SIGNAL FOR METHANOTROPHY IN THE ROCK RECORD. HOWEVER  OUR CULTURES ARE THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF BOTH  THE PRODUCTION OF 3-MEBHPS BY PHOTOTROPHIC BACTERIA AND THEIR PRODUCTION UNDER ANOXIC CONDITIONS.  WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE CELLULAR FUNCTION OF THESE COMPOUNDS IN PNS BY UTILIZING A NOVEL  COMBINATION OF MOLECULAR GENETICS  LABORATORY CULTURE  AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES. THE GOAL IS TO  LINK THE LABORATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERIMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE OBSERVATIONS MADE WITH PURE  CULTURES REFLECT THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF 3-MEBHPS IN THE ENVIRONMENT. SUCH A RELATIONSHIP IS NECESSARY  FOR PROPERLY INTERPRETING THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE COMPOUNDS IN THE SEDIMENTARY ROCK RECORD.  PRELIMINARY PNS PURE CULTURE EXPERIMENTS HAVE REVEALED THAT BOTH TOTAL BHP AND 3-MEBHP INCREASED  RELATIVE TO TOTAL MEMBRANE FATTY ACID WITH INCREASING PH. WE ALSO OBSERVED A CONCOMITANT INCREASE  IN CYCLOPROPANE FATTY ACID (CY19)  INDICATING A MEMBRANE RESPONSE TO PH STRESS. WE PROPOSE TO  INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF HOPANOIDS IN PH HOMEOSTASIS. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED BY IDENTIFYING THE  3-MEBHP BIOSYNTHESIS GENE (HPNR) IN THESE ORGANISMS  AND CREATING DELETION MUTANTS OF THIS GENE FOR  SUBSEQUENT PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES. THE AIM OF THESE STUDIES WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW 3-MEBHP  PRODUCTION IS REGULATED IN RESPONSE TO MEMBRANE STRESS. WE WILL ALSO PERFORM DETAILED  COMPOUND-SPECIFIC C ISOTOPIC STUDIES  AS PRELIMINARY ANALYSES INDICATE THAT THE PNS 3-MEBHPS WILL  BE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM METHANOTROPHIC 3-MEBHPS IN THE ROCK RECORD.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS RELEVANT TO THE EXOBIOLOGY THEME OF EARLY EVOLUTION OF LIFE AND THE  BIOSPHERE  AND OBJECTIVES (II) UNDERSTAND THE PHYLOGENY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF MICROORGANISMS  INCLUDING  EXTREMOPHILES  WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS MAY REFLECT THE NATURE OF PRIMITIVE ENVIRONMENTS; AND VI)  INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION OF GENES  PATHWAYS  AND MICROBIAL SPECIES SUBJECT TO LONG-TERM  ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE RELEVANT TO THE ORIGIN OF LIFE ON EARTH AND THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ELSEWHERE.,NON,M,D,2,,2017-09-28 11:52:18.795543

THE TECHNOLOGY INHERITS FROM THE CHEMIN INSTRUMENT (XRD ON-BOARD THE MSL ROVER) AND A NUMBER OF XRD  INSTRUMENTS DEVELOPED BY THIS TEAM UNDER VARIOUS NASA GRANTS (PIDD  ASTID  SBIR). THE MAIN  INNOVATION OVER PRIOR INSTRUMENTS IS THE CAPABILITY TO OBTAIN HIGH RESOLUTION XRD DATA AND HIGH  THROUGHPUT BY USING PARAFOCUSING DIFFRACTION GEOMETRIES. THIS HELPS ADDRESSING LIMITATIONS OF THE  CURRENT PLANETARY XRD WITH REGARD TO PHASE IDENTIFICATION IN COMPLEX MINERALOGIES  SUCH AS THOSE  RECENTLY OBSERVED WITH THE CHEMIN INSTRUMENT. BOTH TRANSMISSION AND REFLECTION INSTRUMENTS CAN BE  ACHIEVED WITH THIS GUINIER CONCEPT  OFFERING A RANGE OF POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS FROM ON-BOARD  INSTRUMENT FOR POWDER ANALYSIS (SIMILAR TO CHEMIN ON MSL) TO IN-SITU ANALYSIS OF ROCKS AND  REGOLITHS WITH LIMITED TO NO SAMPLE PREPARATION.  MOST MODERN LABORATORY XRD INSTRUMENTS USE PARAFOCUSING IN A LAYOUT DIFFICULT TO APPLY IN THE  CONTEXT OF SPACE-FLIGHT DUE TO THE X- RAY SOURCE AND DETECTOR PRECISION SCANNING REQUIREMENTS. WE  PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A PLANETARY PARAFOCUSING XRD WITHOUT MOVING PART BASED ON CURVED 2D DETECTORS IN GEOMETRIES KNOWN AS SEEMAN-BOHLIN OR GUINIER. THESE GEOMETRIES WERE  DEVELOPED FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION FILM-BASED XRD INSTRUMENTS. GUINIER GEOMETRIES ARE STILL USED TODAY  IN SYNCHROTRON BEAMLINE INSTRUMENTS FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION TIME- RESOLVED XRD STUDIES. THE MAIN  TECHNICAL CHALLENGE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS THE DESIGN  FABRICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A DIGITAL  SOLID-STATE 2D X-RAY DETECTOR TO REPLACE FILMS AND IMAGE PLATES TRADITIONALLY USED WITH THESE  GEOMETRIES. SEVERAL TECHNICAL OPTIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED BASED ON CHARGE-COUPLED DEVICES (CCD): 1 - A CURVED CCD SENSOR  DEVELOPED IN  COLLABORATION WITH THE CCD MANUFACTURER E2V  2 - A COMBINATION OF POLYCAPILLARY X-RAY OPTICS AND  X-RAY SENSITIVE FLAT CCD  3   A COMBINATION OF CYLINDRICAL PHOSPHOR  FIBER OPTICS COUPLER AND  LIGHT-SENSITIVE FLAT CCD.  ALL THREE CONFIGURATIONS WILL BE INVESTIGATED  PROTOTYPED AND EVALUATED.  TRANSMISSION GEOMETRIES IMPOSE A FOCUSED INCIDENT X-RAY BEAM  AS OPPOSED TO REFLECTION GEOMETRIES  WHICH REQUIRE A DIVERGENT BEAM AS PRODUCED BY A MICRO-FOCUSED X-RAY TUBE. ANOTHER TECHNICAL ASPECT  OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE THE EVALUATION OF TECHNOLOGIES FOR BENDING THE DIVERGENT BEAM OF A  MICRO-FOCUSED TUBE INTO THE REQUIRED CONVERGENT BEAM.  MINERALOGY IS KEY TO THE EXPLORATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. OUR INSTRUMENT CONCEPT SERVES FUTURE  LANDED MISSIONS FOR ROBOTIC PLANETARY EXPLORATION. THE TECHNOLOGY COULD ALSO DERIVE INTO ASTRONAUT  FIELD INSTRUMENTS FOR HUMAN EXPLORATION. OUR CONCEPT OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIALLY  IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OVER THE INSTRUMENT CURRENTLY ON MARS.

WE PROPOSE TO SUPPLY THE ASTRONOMICAL COMMUNITY WITH THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL SPECTRA OF A WIDE RANGE OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS PAHS AND PAH CLUSTERS AND TO USE OUR IR ABSORPTION SPECTRA TO CALCULATE EMISSION SPECTRA THAT WILL BE CRUCIAL IN INTERPRETING THE NEW OBSERVATIONAL DATA.THE INFRARED SPACE OBSERVATORY AND SPITZER SPACE TELESCOPES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MID IR EMISSION SPECTRUM OF THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM IS DOMINATED BY STRONG BANDS AT  MICRONS SUPERIMPOSED UPON BROAD UNDERLYING PLATEAUS GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO PAHS  PAH CLUSTERS AND VERY SMALL GRAINS. DESPITE THE LIMITED SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THESE DATA  DETAILED ANALYSIS HAS REVEALED THAT EACH BAND IS  IN FACT  A BLEND OF MULTIPLE EMISSION FEATURES. SUBTLE VARIATIONS IN THE BAND BLENDING CAN BE DETECTED EVEN FOR SPECTRA MEASURED AT DIFFERENT POSITIONS WITHIN A SINGLE ASTRONOMICAL SOURCE. THESE VARIATIONS CAN BE SEEN TO ARISE FROM MULTIPLE PAH AND PAH RELATED CARRIERS THAT ARE EACH RESPONDING DIFFERENTLY TO THE LOCAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE HAS NEAR IR AND MID IR INSTRUMENTS  NIRSPEC AND MIRI  WITH AN EXTREMELY HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION  SPATIAL RESOLUTION  AND SENSITIVITY THAT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE INFRARED ASTRONOMY. THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL PROVIDE SPATIAL MAPS ON A SUB ARCSECOND SCALE WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF SPECTRAL DETAIL  ALLOWING DETAILED STUDY OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS WITHIN EACH EMISSION BAND. THIS WILL PROVIDE A CRITICAL INSIGHT INTO THE MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EMITTING SPECIES AND THEIR  PHOTOCHEMICAL EVOLUTION IN SPACE.EXPLOITATION OF THESE ASTRONOMICAL SPECTRA REQUIRES FUNDAMENTAL DATA ON POTENTIAL EMITTING SPECIES THAT FULLY ACCOUNT FOR ALL ASTROPHYSICALLY RELEVANT MATERIALS. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES  SPECTRA OF NEUTRAL AND CHARGED PAHS HAVE BEEN CALCULATED USING QUANTUM THEORY. DUE TO COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS  THIS DATA SET IS BIASED TOWARDS SMALLER OR HIGHLY SYMMETRIC SPECIES. IN ADDITION  CONTINUED ANALYSIS OF THE MID IR EMISSION BANDS BY SEVERAL RECENT SPITZER STUDIES  HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT PAHS AND PAH CLUSTERSWITH LESS SYMMETRIC STRUCTURES CONTAINING BAY REGIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE IR EMISSION BANDS THAN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN REALIZED. THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFRARED DATA SET ON LESS SYMMETRIC PAHS AND PAH CLUSTERS IS INSUFFICIENT TO EXPLOIT THE ASTRONOMICAL DATA.ADVANCES IN COMPUTING POWER NOW ALLOW SPECTRA FOR A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF SPECIES TO BE CALCULATED. IN SUPPORT OF THE ANALYSIS OF SPITZER DATA AND THE UPCOMING JWST MISSION  WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO CALCULATE THE 3 20 MICRON SPECTRA OF ISOLATED AS WELL AS CLUSTERED NEUTRAL AND CHARGED PAHS CONTAINING UP TO 150 CARBON ATOMS AND WITH A WIDE RANGE OF COMPACT STRUCTURES AND ERODED STRUCTURES WITH IRREGULAR SHAPES CONTAINING BAY REGIONS  COVES  AND FJORDS. THESE THEORETICAL DATA WILL BE VALIDATED BY A DEDICATED LABORATORY STUDY OF PAH SPECIES AND THEIR CLUSTERS.

THIS CHARACTERIZATION AND THESE IMPROVED DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES WILL FACILITATE A MORE PRODUCTIVE UTILIZATION OF LIBS DATA FROM MARS. OUR INVESTIGATION INVOLVES THE USE OF PLASMA IMAGING TECHNOLOGY AND HIGH-RESOLUTION LIBS SPECTROSCOPY IN A MARTIAN ENVIRONMENTAL CHAMBER. OUR TARGET SAMPLES INCLUDE SUITES OF GEOLOGICAL SAMPLES RELEVANT TO THE MARTIAN SURFACE AND SHALLOW SUBSURFACE MATERIALS INCLUDING EVAPORITES  CLAYS  IGNEOUS MATERIALS  AND THE ALTERATION PRODUCTS FROM HYDROTHERMAL AND OTHER GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES. OUR WORK WILL FOCUS ON THE COMPLETION OF THREE TASKS: (1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TO CHARACTERIZE THE DYNAMICS AND THE EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY OF LASER-INDUCED PLASMAS GENERATED IN MARS-RELEVANT TARGETS UNDER MARS SIMULATED ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS; (2) THE PERFORMANCE OF EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON SPECIFIC MINERALS AND MIXTURES IN A MARS SIMULATION CHAMBER; AND (3) THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBS QUANTITATIVE METHODS FOR ELEMENTAL CONCENTRATION DETERMINATIONS AND FOR RAPID MINERAL IDENTIFICATION ON MARS. THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTING OF ATMOSPHERE-SPECIFIC DYNAMIC ANDEMISSION PROPERTIES OF PLASMAS IN LIBS FROM A BROAD RANGE OF MARS-RELEVANT SAMPLES UNDER MARTIAN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO INCLUDE INNOVATIVE METHODS FOR QUANTITATIVE ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF LIBS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF ROVER-BASED MARS EXPLORATION. THE METHODS AND THE SPECTRAL DATA GENERATED DURING THIS PROJECT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO FACILITATE THE INTERPRETATION OF NEW DATA RETURNED BY THE CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT DURING THE MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY MISSION.

HOWEVER  BECAUSE THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST) IS NOMINALLY AN ASTROPHYSICS MISSION  USING MAST FOR PLANETARY RESEARCH POSES CHALLENGES TO THE USER.  FOR EXAMPLE  MAST ENFORCES NO STANDARD OVER HOW TARGETS ARE NAMED  FORCING PLANETARY SCIENTISTS TO MAKE EDUCATED GUESSES AND RISK OVERLOOKING KEY DATA.  SEARCHES BASED ON OTHER CONSTRAINTS LIKE PHASE ANGLE AND ROTATIONAL PHASE ARE NOT POSSIBLE. DATA PRODUCTS  WHEN FOUND  DO NOT CONTAIN THE TYPES OF GEOMETRIC METADATA NECESSARY FOR STRAIGHTFORWARD PLANETARY ANALYSES.  HISTORICALLY  SEVERAL DISCIPLINE NODES OF THE PDS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO BRIDGE THIS GAP. HOWEVER  PRODUCTS ENTER THE HST ARCHIVE CONTINUOUSLY  AND CALIBRATION PROCEDURES ARE UPDATED OFTEN  SO IT HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE PDS TO ENSURE THAT ITS HST HOLDINGS ARE COMPLETE OR UP TO DATE.WE PROPOSE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL  BY FULLY INTEGRATING HST'S SOLAR SYSTEM DATA PRODUCTS INTO THE PLANETARY DATA SYSTEM.  WE WILL DEVELOP A PIPELINE THAT SUPPORTS THE FREQUENT AND NEARLY AUTOMATIC INGESTION OF HST'S PLANETARY DATA PRODUCTS INTO THE PDS REGISTRY  WHERE THEY WILL BE IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE TO THE USERS OF ANY OF THE PDS DISCIPLINE NODES.  THIS TASK WILL INCLUDE THE GENERATION OF KEY METADATA THAT SUPPORTS RICH AND ROBUST SEARCHES OF THE ARCHIVE  SO THAT USERS CAN CONSTRAIN SEARCHES BASED ON FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETERS LIKE TIME  VIEWING AND LIGHTING GEOMETRY  ROTATION  RESOLUTION  ETC. IT WILL ALSO IDENTIFY SECONDARY TARGETS  SUCH AS MOONS AND RINGS  THAT FALL WITHIN EACH FIELD OF VIEW.METHODOLOGY: THIS PROJECT LEVERAGES THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW PDS4 STANDARD. PDS4 PROVIDES A FLEXIBLE  XML-BASED MECHANISM FOR BUNDLING PRODUCTS AND THEIR METADATA  AND FOR PERFORMING AUTOMATIC CONVERSIONS BETWEEN FILE FORMATS.  IN THIS PROJECT  WE WILL DEVELOP A PIPELINE TO SUPPORT TASKS SUCH AS: (1) AUTOMATICALLY QUERYING MAST FOR SOLAR SYSTEM PRODUCTS; (2) STANDARDIZING THE TARGET NAME(S); (3) DEFINING AND GENERATING ALL OF PDS'S DISCIPLINE-SPECIFIC METADATA ACCORDING TO PDS4 STANDARDS; (4) CREATING SPICE KERNELS; AND (5) CONSTRUCTING PDS-COMPLIANT PRODUCT BUNDLES AND ENTERING THEM INTO THE REGISTRY.  THE PROJECT WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT ANY CALIBRATED OR DERIVED PRODUCTS RETRIEVED THROUGH THE PDS4 REGISTRY EMPLOY THE LATEST VERSION OF THE MAST CALIBRATION PIPELINE  BUT THAT PREVIOUS VERSIONS REMAIN ACCESSIBLE.  THIS IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE PDS RINGS NODE HOUSED AT THE SETI INSTITUTE AND THE PDS SMALL BODIES NODE AT U. MARYLAND.  IT BUILDS ON APIS THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR INTERACTING WITH MAST. OTHER PDS NODES WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT AND PERFORM VALIDATION.  THE RINGS NODE WILL TAKE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROJECT COORDINATION AND FOR DEVELOPING THE KEY SOFTWARE TOOLS ACCORDING TO EXISTING PDS4 APIS.  UPON COMPLETION  WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE WORKING PIPELINE CAN CONTINUE TO BE MAINTAINED WITHIN THE BASELINE FUNDING OF THE PDS NODES. RELEVANCE: THIS PROPOSAL WILL OPEN UP WHAT IS ARGUABLY THE SINGLE MOST VALUABLE EARTH-BASED DATA SET TO THE WIDEST POSSIBLE USE WITHIN THE PLANETARY COMMUNITY.  IT THEREFORE SUPPORTS THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PDART PROGRAM TO ""INCREASE THE AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF DIGITAL INFORMATION AND DATA PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR PLANETARY SCIENCE RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION.""

THESE LIMITS ARE IMPOSED BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITIES IN THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE. A NEW APPROACH ISNEEDED TO IMPROVE THE DYNAMIC RANGE. A TECHNIQUE CAPABLE OF MEASURING A 1000:1 DYNAMIC RANGE WOULD ENABLE INVESTIGATION OF A NUMBER OF DIFFICULT OR PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE AERODYNAMIC FLOWS  INCLUDING SUPERSONIC BOUNDARY LAYERS WITH SHOCK INTERACTIONS AND SHOCK-INDUCED SEPARATIONS  VORTEX ROLL-UP WITH TURBULENT WAKE FROM A WING OR ROTOR BLADE  AND JET CORES WITH SHEAR LAYERS. THESE MEASUREMENTS CARRY THE REQUIREMENT OF NOT ONLY HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE BUT ALSO HIGH RESOLUTION AND 3D DATA. THIS DYNAMIC RANGE PROBLEM IS A WELL-KNOWN LIMITATION OF THESE FULL FIELD VELOCIMETRY METHODS  AND EVEN IS THE GOAL OF A FAMOUS CHALLENGE BY A PERSON.

THE PROPOSED WORK IS DIVIDED INTO TWO MAIN THEMES  ONE DEALING WITH THE DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION OF THE SATURNIAN SATELLITE SYSTEM  AND THE OTHER CONCENTRATING ON THE DYNAMICS OF GRAVITATIONALLY BOUND FRAGMENTS IN TNO COLLISIONS.FIRST  WE WILL TEST THE RECENT SUGGESTION BY LAINEY ET AL.(2012) THAT THE TIDAL RESPONSE OF SATURN IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE STRONGER THAN COMMONLY THOUGHT. THEY CLAIM THAT THIS STRON GER TIDAL RESPONSE IS CAUSING ORBITAL MIGRATION OF SATURN'S MOONS THAT IS FASTER THAN CURRENT ESTIMATES. LAINEY ET AL.(2012) DERIVE THIS FAST MIGRATION FROM LONG-BASELINE ASTROMETRIC DATA  AND SHOW THAT LOW TIDAL Q COULDEXPLAIN THE HEAT FLUX OF ENCELADUS. FASTER TIDAL EVOLUTION IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE EVOLVED STATE OF THE TITAN-HYPERION RESONANCE  BUT IMPLIES A RELATIVELY RECENT (RE)ACCRETION OF THE ICY MOONS INTERIOR TO TITAN. IN TASK 1.1  WE PROPOSE TO STUDY A POSSIBLE PAST RESONANCE INVOLVING THE SUN  TITAN AND PREVIOUS-GENERATION ICY SATELLITES (SIMILAR TO ENCELADUS AND DIONE). FOR THE FAST TIDAL EVOLUTION TO BEVIABLE  THIS RESONANCE MUST BE ABLE TO GENERATE THE PRESENT ECCENTRICITY OF TITAN AND DESTABILIZE THE PREVIOUS GENERATION OF MEDIUMSIZED SATELLITES. IN TASK 1.2  WE WILL REVISIT RESONANT ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN THE EXTANT ICY SATELLITES AS THEY EVOLVED INTO THEIR PRESENT ORBITS AND COMPARE RESULTS ACQUIRED USING LOW AND HIGH TIDAL Q VALUES. IN TASK 1.3  WE WILL EXPLORE THE DYNAMICS OF IAPETUS OVER BILLIONS OF YEARS. IAPETUS IS UNIQUE AMONG SATELLITES AS IT IS EQUALLY PERTURBED BY TITAN AND THE SUN. WE WILL CONSTRUCT A SECULAR MODEL TO EFFICIENTLY MODEL IAPETUS'S ORBIT  AND CONSTRAIN POSSIBLE CHANGES TO ITS INITIAL ECCENTRICITY AND INCLINATION OVER THE LAST 4 GYR.SECOND  WE WILL STUDY THE DYNAMICS OF ECCENTRIC DEBRIS ORIGINATING IN COLLISIONS THAT FORMED THE PLUTO-CHARON BINARY AND POSSIBLY THE 1999 TC_36 TRIPLE. BOTH SYSTEMS HAVE LARGE OBLIQUITIES  ENABLING LOOSELY BOUND EJECTA FROM THE COLLISIONS TO EXPERIENCE STRONG PERTURBATIONS FROM THE SUN (THE ""KOZAI RESONANCE""). THIS PROCESS COULD DECOUPLE THE DEBRIS FROM THE INNER BOUNDARY LONG ENOUGH FORTHE INNER BINARY TO EVOLVE TIDALLY AND PREVENT FURTHER KOZAI OSCILLATIONS. IN TASK 2  WE WILL CONSTRUCT A FULL BULIRSCH-STOER INTEGRATOR IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF SUCH MATERIAL COULD EVENTUALLY FORM THE SMALL MOONS OF PLUTO. WE WILL APPLY THE SAME ANALYSIS TO THE TNO TRIPLE 1999 TC_36}. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE WHETHER SOLAR RESONANCES AFFECT THE DYNAMICS OF THE RESULTANT PROTO-SATELLITE DISK AROUND PLUTO.",NON,M,B,2,,2017-10-05 18:22:54.41575

BECAUSE GYPSUM IS FORMED IN THE PRESENCE OF LIQUID WATER  THE DISCOVERY OF THIS EXTENSIVE DEPOSIT HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CLIMATIC AND SEDIMENTARY HISTORY OF THE CURRENTLY COLD AND DRY NORTH POLAR REGION OF MARS. INDEED  THE PRESENCE OF THIS MINERAL WITHIN AMAZONIAN STRATA 3.5 GA COULD HAVE GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS  BECAUSE IT CONTRADICTS THE CURRENT VIEW THAT SULFATE MINERALS ONLY FORMED IN ABUNDANCE ON MARS MUCH EARLIER IN THE PLANETS HISTORY  DURING THE HESPERIAN OR THEIIKIAN EPOCH 3.5 GA. IMAGES FROM THE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS CRISM INDICATE THAT GYPSUM SAND GRAINS APPEAR TO CONCENTRATE AT DUNE CRESTS  BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER AEOLIAN PROCESSES ALONE COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS EFFECT  NOR WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PATTERN MAY BE. DESPITE ITS POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE IN UNRAVELING MARS GEOLOGICAL HISTORY  THE ORIGIN OF THE GYPSUM AND ITS ROLE IN SEDIMENTARY AND POLAR PROCESSES IS DISPUTED AND POORLY CONSTRAINED. WHAT IS LACKING FROM CURRENT STUDIES  AND WHAT WOULD ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF SULFATE ORIGIN AND TRANSPORT HISTORY  ARE TWO INVESTIGATIONS 1. AN EXAMINATION OF HOW AEOLIAN PROCESSES DISTRIBUTE GYPSUM GRAINS ACROSS ACTIVE DUNES  AND 2. A COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION STUDY OF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN AEOLIAN MORPHOLOGY AND HYDRATED MINERAL CONCENTRATION IN THE NORTH POLAR SAND SEAS. WE PROPOSE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WITH THE FOLLOWING TWO OBJECTIVES OBJECTIVE 1. PERFORM FIELD AND LAB ANALYSES OF MINERAL ABUNDANCE AND GRAIN SIZE USING A TERRESTRIAL ANALOG DUNES CONTAINING BOTH GYPSUM AND MORE RESISTANT TERRIGENOUS QUARTZ GRAINS AT WHITE SANDS NATIONAL MONUMENT IN NEW MEXICO. USING BOTH A VISIBLE NEAR INFRARED VNIR SPECTROMETER AND AN XRAY DIFFRACTION XRD SYSTEM  THIS WORK WILL DETERMINE HOW AEOLIAN PROCESSES INFLUENCE THE TRANSPORT AND GRAIN SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF GYPSUM SAND RELATIVE TO HARDER SAND GRAINS. OBJECTIVE 2. INVESTIGATE CRISM SPECTRA  AS WELL AS HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING SCIENCE EXPERIMENT HIRISE AND CONTEXT CAMERA CTX IMAGES SPANNING OLYMPIA UNDAE  TO DETERMINE HOW THE CONCENTRATION OF GYPSUM AND OTHER HYDRATED MINERALS VARIES WITH THE SEDIMENTARY HISTORY OF THE SAND SEA. THE GOAL OF THESE OBJECTIVES IS TO CONSTRAIN THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF GYPSUM IN THE SAND SEA. THE EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS TO EXPLAIN THE PRESENCE OF YOUNG AMAZONIAN HYDRATED MINERALS ON A PLANET WHERE MOST OTHER SUCH MINERALS ARE MUCH OLDER HESPERIAN. IN ADDITION  THE WORK WILL DETERMINE THE TRANSPORT HISTORY OF GYPSUM GRAINS WITHIN OLYMPIA UNDAE  WHICH MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR CLIMATE DRIVEN SHIFTS IN WIND REGIME. FINALLY  COORDINATING VNIR REFLECTANCE DATA AND XRD DATA IN THE FIELD WILL PROVIDE BACKGROUND IN AN AEOLIAN ENVIRONMENT BEARING HYDRATED SULFATES  PROVIDING GROUND TRUTH FOR THE CHEMISTRY AND MINERALOGY INSTRUMENT CHEMIN ON THE MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY  AND PREPARING FOR ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CRISM DATA FROM ORBIT AND XRD DATA ON THE SURFACE.,NON,M,B,2,,2017-10-18 15:29:18.339047

PROJECT SUMMARY: THE SETI INSTITUTE (SI) TEAM PROPOSES A RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT WILL DEVELOP A ROADMAP TO BIOSIGNATURE EXPLORATION IN SUPPORT OF NASA'S DECADAL PLAN FOR THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS.  THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY FOR NASA TO SEARCH FOR ANCIENT TRACES OF LIFE ON MARS WILL BE 2020  WHEN A CURIOSITY-CLASS ROVER IS EXPECTED TO EXPLORE ANCIENT HABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS AND CACHE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SAMPLES.  CACHING SAMPLES IS HIGH-COST AND HIGH RISK  AND THE SINGLE MOST COMPELLING QUESTION TO ASK IN SUPPORT OF SUCH A MISSION IS: HOW DO WE IDENTIFY AND CACHE THE MOST VALUABLE SAMPLES?  THE SI MAKES THIS QUESTION THE INTELLECTUAL FOCUS OF IT RESEARCH PROGRAM.  FOUR RESEARCH AREAS STUDY THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THIS CENTRAL QUESTION.  WITHIN THEM FOCUS AREAS REGROUP INVESTIGATIONS THAT SYNERGISTICALLY TACKLE KEY ASPECTS OF EARLY MARS HABITABILITY  TAPHONOMIC WINDOWS AND BIOSIGNATURE POTENTIAL  THEIR PRESERVATION POTENTIAL  AND THEIR DETECTABILITY.  RESEARCH IS PERFORMED THROUGH AN INTEGRATED EXPLORATION OF EVER-INCREASING RESOLUTION THAT CORRELATES MEASUREMENT FROM MEGASCALE TO MOLECULAR SCALE  AND ENVISIONS EACH ESSENTIAL COMPONENT THROUGH THE UNIQUE PRISM OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING EARLY MARTIAN ENVIRONMENT.  ULTIMATELY  IT PRODUCES GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE TO RESEARCH  WHAT TO SEARCH FOR  AND HOW TO SEARCH.THE RESEARCH PROGRAM PROPOSED BY THE SI TEAM IS TIMELY  NEEDED  AND WILL DIRECTLY SUPPORT A DECADE OF SEARCHES FOR LIFE ON MARS THAT MAY CULMINATE WITH A MARS SAMPLE RETURN MISSION.SCIENTIFICALLY  WE WILL CHARACTERIZE TERRESTRIAL ANALOGS TO ENVIRONMENTS AND BIOGEOMATERIALS CONSIDERED OF HIGH-PRIORITY TO THE SEARCH FOR TRACES OF ANCIENT LIFE ON MARS  AND WILL INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGING EARLY MARS CONDITIONS ON THE PRESERVATION OF BIOSIGNATURES.  INVESTIGATING THE PHYSICAL  BIMOLECULAR  AND METABOLIC RECORDS OF LIFE IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS  OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL DEFINE THEIR HABITABILITY POTENTIAL  TAPHONOMIC WINDOWS  POTENTIAL FOR BIOSIGNATURES AND THEIR PRESERVATION POTENTIAL.EXCELLENCE IN ASTROBIOLOGY  MARS TAPHONOMY  WORLD-CLASS LEADERSHIP IN THE EXPLORATION OF MARS ANALOGS  DEEP INVOLVEMENT IN MARS MISSIONS AND PROGRAMMATIC DECISIONS  AND ACCESS TO EXCEPTIONAL FIELD  LABORATORY AND INSTRUMENT ASSETS UNIQUELY POSITION THE SI TEAM TO BRING TO THE NAI THE MEANS OF PROVIDING CRITICAL EXPLORATION GUIDELINES TO SUPPORT THE SEARCH FOR LIFE THE MARS.",NON,12,B,2,,2017-03-06 00:00:00

NH3 HAS ALSO BEEN FOUND ON THE SURFACES OF THE SMALLER MOONS NIX AND HYDRA AS WELL AS ON THE SURFACES OF ORCUS AND QUAOAR. THIS IS UNUSUAL SINCE NH3 SHOULD NOT SURVIVE ON THE SURFACE OF THESE ICY BODIES FOR LONGER THAN A FEW MILLION YEARS DUE TO THE PROTON RADIATION FLUX IN THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM. AS OF TODAY  NO MECHANISM FOR PRESERVING NH3 ON THE SURFACE OF THESE BODIES HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AS DEFINITIVE. FOR CHARON  MECHANISMS SUCH AS CRYOVOLCANISM HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED TO EXPLAIN THE PRESENCE OF THIS ICE BUT THESE ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH A MOON TOO SMALL TO SUSTAIN A SUBMERGED LIQUID OCEAN. ANOTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS THAT NH3 IS ONE OF THE PRIMORDIAL CONSTITUENTS OF CHARON. SUBSURFACE NH3 WOULD THEN BE DIFFUSING UP INTO CHARON S SURFACE H2O ICE LAYER. BASED UPON THE BROADENED SHAPE OF CHARON S 2.21  M BAND  NH3 ALSO APPEARS TO BE COMPLEXED IN H2O IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND IN DIFFERENT AMOUNTS  THUS ADDING TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF ITS ORIGIN. THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STABILITY OF NH3/H2O ICES AS A FUNCTION OF ICE STRUCTURE  CONCENTRATION  AND TEMPERATURE  AND TO PROVIDE NEAR-IR SPECTRAL DATA OF NH3 IN H2O ICES THAT WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF OBSERVATIONS OF OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM BODIES.,NON,M,A,2,,2017-11-21 14:58:23.749821

THE KEPLER DATA HAS BEEN USED PRIMARILY TO SEARCH FOR TRANSITING EXTRASOLAR PLANETS.  WHEN A PLANET TRANSITS ITS HOST STAR  SOME LIGHT IS BLOCKED  WHICH IS OBSERVED AS A DECREASE IN FLUX BY A DISTANT OBSERVER. HOWEVER  IF THE TRANSITING OBJECT IS COMPACT WITH SIGNIFICANT MASS  SUCH AS A WHITE-DWARF (WD)  THEN GRAVITATIONAL LENSING WILL OCCUR AND PRODUCE A MAGNIFICATION OF THE HOST STAR RESULTING IN AN OBSERVED INCREASE IN FLUX. FOR WHITE-DWARFS IN ORBITAL PERIODS OF 100 DAYS OR LONGER  THE AMPLITUDE OF MICROLENSING WILL BE STRONGER THAN THE OBSERVED TRANSIT  THE RESULTING EVENT IS OBSERVED AS AN INVERTED TRANSIT. WE PROPOSE TO SEARCH THE KEPLER DATASET FOR BOTH TRANSITS AND ANTI-TRANSITS. THIS DATA SET WILL BE USED TO SEARCH FOR COMPACT OBJECTS SUCH A WHITE DWARFS TO COMPUTE OCCURRENCE RATES IN THE KEPLER FIELD OF VIEW AND UNDERSTAND THE FATE OF HIGH-MASS BINARIES. A WELL CHARACTERIZED MICROLENSING SEARCH GIVES A DIRECT MEASUREMENT ON THE RATE OF STELLAR REMNANTS AND A DIRECT PROBE OF STELLAR EVOLUTION OF CLOSELY SEPARATED (~1 AU) BINARIES. METHODOLOGY: 1) WE WILL USE A TRANSIT SEARCH ALGORITHM THAT IS SENSITIVE TO BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE DIPS IN THE LIGHT CURVE TO FIND BOTH PLANETS AND MIRCOLENSING EVENTS. 2) WE WILL PERFORM TRANSIT INJECTION TESTS TO CHARACTERIZE OUR SEARCH PROGRAM. 3) WE WILL GENERATE PUBLIC LISTS OF OUR CANDIDATES AND SENSITIVITY RATES. 4) WE WILL CALCULATE THE OCCURRENCE RATES OF COMPACT OBJECTS IN THE KEPLER FIELD-OF-VIEW. RELEVANCE: OUR PLANNED RESEARCH USES NASA'S KEPLER LEGACY PRODUCTS TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BINARY SYSTEMS. OUR PLANNED RESEARCH WILL DIRECTLY EXPLAIN OBSERVATIONS OF THE EVOLUTION OF BINARY SYSTEMS BY PROVIDING UNIFORM ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF OBSERVATIONS AND DERIVE FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF THE SYSTEMS.,NON,M,B,2,,2018-03-06 17:27:01.301867

THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO STUDY THE ORBITAL EVOLUTION OF THREE INTERESTING GROUPS OF SMALL BODIES IN THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM: METEOROIDS ORIGINATING IN THE HUNGARIA REGION  SMALL BINARY ASTEROIDS  AND MARS TROJANS. THE FIRST THEME CONCERNS THE DYNAMICS OF METEOROIDS ORIGINATING THE HUNGARIA ASTEROID GROUP BETWEEN MARS AND THE ASTEROID BELT. WE WILL SHOW THAT DELIVERY ROUTES OF METEOROIDS FROM HUNGARIAS TO EARTH OR MARS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE FOR THE MAIN-BELT ASTEROIDS. THE HUNGARIA GROUP IS DOMINATED BY E-TYPE ASTEROIDS THAT ARE LIKELY PARENT BODIES OF AUBRITE METEORITES (CLARK ET AL. 2004)  WHICH HAVE THE OLDEST CRE AGES OF ALL STONY METEORITES (EUGSTER ET AL. 2006). IN TASK 1.1  WE WILL USE NUMERICAL INTEGRATIONS TO TEST IF THE CRE AGES OF AUBRITES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR ORIGIN IN THE HUNGARIA FAMILY. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE HUNGARIAS AS A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF METEORITES (POSSIBLY RELATED TO MESOSIDERITES) THAT WERE FOUND ON MARS BY MER ROVERS (TASK 1.2). IN BOTH CASES  WE ARE EXPLORING A CONNECTIONBETWEEN SPECIFIC METEORITE TYPES AND AN ASTEROID GROUP. IF AUBRITES CAN BE TRACED BACK TO 434 HUNGARIA  AND MESOSIDERITES TO SOME OTHER ASTEROID IN THE SAME REGION  WE WILL GAIN INVALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PAST OF THESE METEORITES AND THEIR PARENT BODIES. THE SECOND THEME FOCUSES ON FURTHER EXPLORATION OF THE DYNAMICS OF BINARY ASTEROIDS. CUK AND BURNS (2005) DISCOVERED THE BYORP RADIATION EFFECT FOR SMALL BINARY ASTEROIDS  AND CUK AND NESVORNY (2010) PIONEERED THE STUDY OF THEIR CHAOTIC ROTATION AND SPIN-ORBIT INTERACTIONS. WE PROPOSE TO EXPAND THE APPROACH OF CUK AND NESVORNY (2010) BY EXPLORING THE WIDER RANGE OF SECONDARY SIZES AND SHAPES  INCLUDING THE SPIN-ORBIT INTERACTIONS OF THE PRIMARY AND MULTIPLE SATELLITE DYNAMICS (TASK 2.1). IN TASK 2.2 WE WILL EXTEND THIS MODEL TO ALL THREE DIMENSIONS  AS THE SPIN-ORBIT INTERACTIONS TEND TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY WHEN ALL ANGULAR MOMENTA ARE NOT ALIGNED. OUR STUDIES OF POST-FORMATION EVOLUTION OF BINARY ASTEROIDS COMPLEMENT STUDIES OF THEIR ORIGIN  AND ARE INDISPENSABLE FOR COMPARISON BETWEEN THE THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS AND OBSERVED SYSTEMS. AT LEAST THREE OF THE SIX PRESENTLY KNOWN MARS TROJANS HAVE SIMILAR ORBITS (""EUREKA CLUSTER"")  WITH CLUSTERED ECCENTRICITIES ANDINCLINATIONS  AND SMALL LIBRATION AMPLITUDES. IN THE THIRD THEME  WE PROPOSE TO DETERMINE  USING NUMERICAL INTEGRATIONS  IF THE PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF EUREKA CLUSTER MEMBERS IS AN ARTIFACT OF STABILITY OR RESULT OF DIFFUSION FROM A PAST BREAKUP (TASK 3.1). THE FIRST TASK WILL INVOLVE INTEGRATING BOTH CLONES OF THE REAL EUREKA AND GRIDS OF TEST PARTICLES. WE ALSO IDENTIFY A NEAR-RESONANCE BETWEEN THE TROJANS' LIBRATION AMPLITUDE AND A COMBINATION OF THE MEAN MOTIONS OF MARS  JUPITER AND EARTH. IN OUR SECOND TASK (3.2)  WE WILL EXPLORE HOW THE EXISTENCE OF THIS COMPLEX THREE-PLANET RESONANCE AFFECTS THE LONG-TERM STABILITY AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF MARS TROJANS. AS MARS TROJANS MAY BE THE ONLY CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE REMNANTS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANET FORMATION  IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO ESTABLISH THEIRPAST DYNAMICAL STABILITY  AND SEPARATE THE INITIALLY DISTINCT BODIES FROM THEIR LATER COLLISIONAL FRAGMENTS.",NON,12,B,2,,2017-05-19 00:00:00

OBJECTIVES - WE PROPOSE TO INVESTIGATE THE PHYLLOSILICATE-BEARING OUTCROPS IN THE LIBYA MONTES REGION  CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT CARBONATES ARE PRESENT  AND CHARACTERIZE THE GEOLOGIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AQUEOUS UNITS AND MAFIC ROCKS. ONE CHALLENGE TO DETECTION OF CARBONATES ON MARS IS THAT A NUMBER OF FE-BEARING PHYLLOSILICATES ALSO HAVE A BAND NEAR 2.3 M. OUR PRELIMINARY STUDY OF THE SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF NONTRONITE-MAGNESITE MIXTURES SHOWED THAT THE CARBONATE 2.3 M BAND MAY BE OVERSHADOWED BY THE NONTRONITE BAND UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF CARBONATES IN MIXTURES  WE PROPOSE TO PREPARE SEVERAL NEW CARBONATE MIXTURES AND EVALUATE THEM USING REFLECTANCE AND MOSSBAUER SPECTROSCOPY AND XRD. WE WILL THEN USE THE VNIR RESULTS OF THE CARBONATE-PHYLLOSILICATE MIXTURES TO RESOLVE WHETHER OR NOT CARBONATES ARE PRESENT AT LIBYA MONTES. THIS PROJECT REQUIRES COORDINATED DATA ANALYSIS AND LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE UNIQUELY SUPPORTED BY PGG  AND NOT BY OTHER NASA MARS RESEARCH PROGRAMS. SUMMARY OF RESEARCH TASKS: OUR PROJECT INCLUDES FIVE COORDINATED TASKS DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE THE COMPOSITION  CHARACTER AND STRATIGRAPHY OF THE AQUEOUS MINERALOGY AT LIBYA MONTES AND REVISE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE VALLEY NETWORKS ALONG THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF ISIDIS BASIN AND THE DOMINANT GEOLOGIC PROCESSES THAT HAVE GOVERNED THE ISIDIS PLANITIA REGION: 1) HYPERSPECTRAL ANALYSES OF THE LIBYA MONTES REGION WITH CRISM DATA IN ORDER TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY THE MINERALS PRESENT  2) GEOLOGIC ANALYSES OF THE LIBYA MONTES REGION WITH HRSC IMAGE DATA AND DTMS  AND CTX IMAGE DATA TO GAIN MORPHOLOGICAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON A BROAD SCALE AND WITH HIRISE IMAGE DATA AND DTMS TO GAIN MORPHOLOGICAL AND TEXTURAL INFORMATION ON A FINER SCALE  3) PREPARATION OF MIXTURES OF CARBONATE AND PHYLLOSILICATE MINERALS IN THE LAB AND CHARACTERIZATION WITH VNIR  MB AND XRD  4) SPECTRAL ANALYSES OF THE MIXTURE DATA INCLUDING QUANTITATIVE BAND DEPTH CHARACTERIZATIONS AND GAUSSIAN MODELING COMPARED TO QUANTITATIVE MINERAL ABUNDANCE DETERMINATIONS FROM XRD AND MOSSBAUER SPECTROSCOPY  5) COORDINATED SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSES OF THE DATA IN ORDER I) TO CONFIRM (OR POSSIBLY REFUTE) THE PRESENCE OF CARBONATE AT LIBYA MONTES  II) TO DETERMINE THE LIKELY TYPE(S) OF CARBONATE MINERALS PRESENT  III) TO CONSTRAIN THE LIKELY ABUNDANCES OF THE CARBONATE AND OTHER MINERALS PRESENT  IV) TO CHARACTERIZE THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ASSIGN RELATIVE AGES OF THE AQUEOUS UNITS (E.G. CARBONATES OLDER OR YOUNGER OR CO-EVOLVED WITH PHYLLOSILICATES AND OLIVINE?)  AND V) TO DETERMINE WHAT RELATIONSHIPS THERE ARE BETWEEN CARBONATES (IF PRESENT) AND OTHER LITHOLOGIES IN THE REGION. EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE: LIBYA MONTES IS ONE OF ONLY A FEW PLACES ON MARS EXHIBITING CARBONATE AND PHYLLOSILICATE SIGNATURES. THESE TWO MINERALS TOGETHER ARE STRONG INDICATORS OF NEUTRAL WATERS. UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE AQUEOUS DEPOSITS AT LIBYA MONTES HAS POTENTIALLY FAR-REACHING APPLICATIONS FOR THE GREATER ISIDIS BASIN REGION. IF SIMILAR PROCESSES FORMED PHYLLOSILICATES AND CARBONATES AT NILI FOSSAE AND LIBYA MONTES THEN THESE PROCESSES COULD BE VERY WIDESPREAD IN THE ANCIENT ROCKS ACROSS THE ISIDIS REGION. THIS STUDY COULD REVEAL THAT CARBONATES ARE MORE PREVALENT ON MARS THAN REALIZED TO DATE.,NON,12,B,2,,2017-02-21 00:00:00

THE TWO PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO (1) SUPPORT THE CLOSEOUT OF THE KEPLER SCIENCE MISSION AND (2) SUPPORT THE K2 SCIENCE OPERATIONS FROM THE COLLECTION OF DATA TO THE ARCHIVING OF THE MISSION RESULTS. THE PROPOSED KEPLER WORK WILL OCCUR FROM JUNE 2017 THROUGH THE END OF THE KEPLER CLOSEOUT AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2017. THE PROPOSED K2 WORK WILL OCCUR FROM JUNE 2017 THROUGH THE END OF THE K2 MISSION. METHODS: THE WORK PROPOSED HERE SUPPORTS ELEVEN SCIENTISTS  BOTH FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME  WHO WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE KEPLER SCIENCE CLOSEOUT AND THE K2 MISSION OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING AS A PART OF THE KEPLER SCIENCE OFFICE (SO) AND SCIENCE OPERATIONS CENTER (SOC) AT NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER. ALL OF THE PROPOSAL TEAM ARE EXPERIENCED MEMBERS OF THE KEPLER/K2 TEAM. SCIENTISTS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THE WORK PLAN AND COORDINATING THE PERSONNEL REQUIRED TO CARRY OUT EACH ASSIGNED ACTIVITY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT PROPOSAL AND THE KEPLER/KL PROJECT SCHEDULE. PERCEIVED IMPACT: THE PROPOSED WORK IN SUPPORT OF KEPLER IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL CLOSEOUT OF THE MISSION AND THE COMPLETION OF A LEGACY ARCHIVE. TWO OF THE KEY GOALS FOR THE KEPLER CLOSEOUT WERE THE CREATION OF A UNIFORMLY VETTED PLANET CANDIDATE CATALOG AND THE CREATION OF A SERIES OF OCCURRENCE RATE PRODUCTS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO COMPUTE PLANET OCCURRENCE RATES INDEPENDENTLY. THESE PRODUCTS AND THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION WERE DEEMED CRITICAL FOR KEPLER'S LEGACY BY THE KEPLER MISSION  THE KEPLER USERS PANEL  AND THE EXTERNAL OCCURRENCE RATE REVIEW PANEL  AND HAVE BEEN ON THE KEPLER CLOSEOUT SCHEDULE APPROVED BY THE NASA EXOPLANET PROGRAM OFFICE. CO-IS ON THIS PROPOSAL ARE LEADING THE CATALOG  OCCURRENCE RATE  AND LEGACY DOCUMENTATION EFFORTS. THE WORK PROPOSED FOR K2 PRIMARILY INVOLVES SUPPORT FOR MISSION FLIGHT OPERATIONS  DATA PROCESSING OPERATIONS  AND DATA ARCHIVAL. SCIENTISTS ON THIS PROPOSAL ARE CRITICAL TO ALL PHASES OFK2 OPERATIONS FROM FIELD-OF-VIEW AND TARGET SELECTION THROUGH FINAL MISSION DATA AND DOCUMENTATION DELIVERY TO THE MAST.

THERE IS AN INCREASING NEED FOR HIGHLY ACCURATE ROVIBRATIONAL LINE LISTS INCLUDING INFRARED INTENSITIES OF SMALL MOLECULES THAT ARE COMMON IN VARIOUS ASTROPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES. THIS IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE AVAILABILITY OF EVER INCREASINGLY HIGH RESOLUTION TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS  INCLUDING SPACE BASED SUCH AS  HERSCHEL AND  JWST   PLANE BASED  SUCH  AS  SOFIA  AND GROUND  BASED  SUCH  AS  ALMA. FURTHER  FOR MANY OF THE MOLECULES OF INTEREST  THE LINE LISTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPAN A LARGE TEMPERATURE RANGE SINCE THEY EXISTS IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS THAT SPAN A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE. ONE SUCH MOLECULE IS S02  WHICH WAS CLASSIFIED AS ONE OF NINE ""WEED"" MOLECULES BY THE HIFI COMMUNITY. ADDITIONALLY  IT COMMONLY OCCURS ON PLANETS OR MOONS THAT EXHIBIT VOLCANIC ACTIVITY  AND THUS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC MOLECULE IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES FOR EXAMPLE  S02 COMPOSES ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF JUPITER'S MOON IO  AND JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WAS FOUND TO BE PROMINENT IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE OF VENUS. WE PROPOSE  TO  USE  A  COMBINATION  OF  THEORY  AND  HIGH RESOLUTION  EXPERIMENTS  TO  DETERMINE  A  HIGHLY  ACCURATE ROVIBRATIONAL LINE LIST FOR S02 AND ITS ISOTOPOLOGUES THAT WILL BE ACCURATE TO VERY HIGH J VALUES  UP TO J EQUAL200 AND UP TO 20 000 CM L ABOVE THE ZERO POINT LEVEL. THROUGH THE USE OF HIGH ACCURACY ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS  AND  REFINEMENT  OF  THE RESULTING  POTENTIAL  ENERGY  SURFACE PES WITH  THE  AVAILABLE  EXPERIMENTAL  DATA   THIS APPROACH HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO GENERATE HIGHLY ACCURATE LINE LISTS FOR ISOTOPOLOGUES OF THE WATER MOLECULE  THE AMMONIA MOLECULE  AND MOST RECENTLY CARBON DIOXIDE. FOR ALL THREE  THE ACCURACY OF THE RESULTING PES  TRANSITION ENERGIES  AND INTENSITIES HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY LATER HIGH RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPIC STUDIES. WE HAVE COMPLETED AN INITIAL LINE LIST FOR 32SL602  THOUGH THERE IS FURTHER REFINEMENT NEEDED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY AND EXTEND IT TO HIGHER J VALUES. FURTHER  ONCE A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE LINE LIST HAS BEEN  DETERMINED FOR 32SL602  THIS WILL BE EXTENDED TO ITS ISOTOPOLOGUES  INCLUDING 34SL602  32SL60L80  32SL802  34SL60L80  AND 34SL802. FURTHER  WE PROPOSE TO GO BEYOND WEEDING SPECTRA AND DEVELOP ROBUST STATE OF THE ART THEORETICAL SPECTROSCOPY METHODS TO GENERATE LIMITED LINE LISTS FOR SMALL TRANSIENT MOLECULES FOR WHICH THERE IS LITTLE OR NO EXPERIMENTAL DATA AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO AID ASTRONOMERS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE MANY AS YET UNASSIGNED LINES IN HIFI SPECTRA AND THAT WILL BE FOUND WITH THE GREAT AND EXES INSTRUMENTS ON SOFIA. LINE LISTS FOR THESE MOLECULES WILL BE LIMITED TO PURELY ROTATIONAL TRANSITIONS AS WELL AS THE ROVIBRATIONAL BANDS OF ALL FUNDAMENTALS. INITIALLY  WE WILL TARGET THE LIMITED LINE LIST STUDIES ON THE NH4  H2CL AND H20 MOLECULAR CATIONS. THESE HIGHLY ACCURATE LINE LISTS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE ASTRONOMY AND EXOPLANET COMMUNITIES  FOR USE  IN ANALYZING DATA FROM HERSCHEL AND SOFIA  AMONG OTHER NASA MISSIONS  AND GROUND BASED TELESCOPES SUCH AS ALMA.",NON,12,B,2,,2017-04-05 00:00:00

OUR RESEARCH IS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL BECAUSE IT INTIMATELY COMBINES STATE OF THE ART GLOBAL MODELS OF GROWTH BY STICKING  AND RADIAL TRANSPORT  OF POROUS AGGREGATE PARTICLES (CONSTRAINED BY LIMITED EXPERIMENTS ON IDEAL MATERIALS) WITH PROBLEM-FOCUSSED STUDIES OF SOME OF THE MOST LONGSTANDING PUZZLES OF METEORITICS. THE PROCESSES OF PHYSICS AND THE PROPERTIES OF METEORITES SPEAK IN TWO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES  BUT WE NEED BOTH TO UNDERSTAND THE EARLIEST STAGES OF PLANET FORMATION. UNDERNEATH IT ALL  PLANET FORMATION IS GEOLOGY  IN THE SENSE THAT IT CAN BE RESISTANT TO CLEAN MATHEMATICAL SOLUTIONS. THE TECHNIQUES WE PROPOSE ARE NECESSARILY NUMERICAL  WITH PARAMETERS BASED ON PHYSICAL PROCESSES WHICH HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN STUDIED MORE RIGOROUSLY BY OTHERS.

WE BELIEVE THIS OVERALL PROGRAM REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD TOWARD REPLACING THE USUAL  COSMIC ABUNDANCE  MINIMUM MASS NEBULA  WITH A MORE REALISTIC INITIAL SETTING FOR PLANET FORMATION.WE PROPOSE FIVE BASIC TASKS  DENOTED BY THEIR SECTION NUMBERS: (6.1) IMPLEMENT A FEW KEY PHYSICAL PROCESSES INTO THE CODE  INCLUDING EXTERNAL MASS LOSS AND/OR GAIN FROM DISK WINDS OR INFALL; (6.2) STUDY VARIATIONS ON THE PROCESS OF POROUS/FRACTAL GROWTH AND DETERMINE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PRIMARY FORMATION OF PLANETESIMALS; (6.3) STUDY THE TRANSPORT OF ANOMALOUS  HEAVY  OXYGEN ISOTOPES FROM THE OUTER NEBULA INTO PRIMITIVE CHONDRITES  COMPARING MODEL TIMESCALES WITH OBSERVED ONES; (6.4) TEST A NEW HYPOTHESIS FOR THE LONGSTANDING PROBLEM OF THE SYSTEMATIC DEPLETION OF THE MODERATELY VOLATILE ELEMENTS IN CHONDRITES AND PLANETS; (6.5) UNDERSTAND THE SUBSTANTIAL DEPLETION OF CHONDRITES (INCLUDING CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES) IN CARBON RELATIVE TO COSMIC ABUNDANCE. THE WORK WILL PROVIDE REALISTIC INITIAL CONDITIONS FOR PRIMARY ACCRETION OF PLANETESIMALS AND PLANETS IN THE INNER AND OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM  AND A PROTOPLANETARY DISK CONTEXT FOR PRIMITIVE METEORITE PROPERTIES THAT IS NOW LACKING  INCLUDING A CONNECTION BETWEEN OBSERVED PROPERTIES AND NEBULA TIMESCALES.

THERE IS AN INCREASING NEED FOR HIGHLY ACCURATE ROVIBRATIONAL LINE LISTS INCLUDING INFRARED INTENSITIES OF SMALL MOLECULES THAT ARE COMMON IN VARIOUS ASTROPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES. THIS IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE AVAILABILITY OF EVER INCREASINGLY HIGH RESOLUTION TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS  INCLUDING SPACE BASED SUCH AS  HERSCHEL AND  JWST   PLANE BASED  SUCH  AS  SOFIA  AND GROUND  BASED  SUCH  AS  ALMA. FURTHER  FOR MANY OF THE MOLECULES OF INTEREST  THE LINE LISTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPAN A LARGE TEMPERATURE RANGE SINCE THEY EXISTS IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS THAT SPAN A WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE. ONE SUCH MOLECULE IS S02  WHICH WAS CLASSIFIED AS ONE OF NINE ""WEED"" MOLECULES BY THE HIFI COMMUNITY. ADDITIONALLY  IT COMMONLY OCCURS ON PLANETS OR MOONS THAT EXHIBIT VOLCANIC ACTIVITY  AND THUS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC MOLECULE IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES FOR EXAMPLE  S02 COMPOSES ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF JUPITER'S MOON IO  AND JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WAS FOUND TO BE PROMINENT IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE OF VENUS. WE PROPOSE  TO  USE  A  COMBINATION  OF  THEORY  AND  HIGH RESOLUTION  EXPERIMENTS  TO  DETERMINE  A  HIGHLY  ACCURATE ROVIBRATIONAL LINE LIST FOR S02 AND ITS ISOTOPOLOGUES THAT WILL BE ACCURATE TO VERY HIGH J VALUES  UP TO J EQUAL200 AND UP TO 20 000 CM L ABOVE THE ZERO POINT LEVEL. THROUGH THE USE OF HIGH ACCURACY ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS  AND  REFINEMENT  OF  THE RESULTING  POTENTIAL  ENERGY  SURFACE PES WITH  THE  AVAILABLE  EXPERIMENTAL  DATA   THIS APPROACH HAS ALREADY BEEN USED TO GENERATE HIGHLY ACCURATE LINE LISTS FOR ISOTOPOLOGUES OF THE WATER MOLECULE  THE AMMONIA MOLECULE  AND MOST RECENTLY CARBON DIOXIDE. FOR ALL THREE  THE ACCURACY OF THE RESULTING PES  TRANSITION ENERGIES  AND INTENSITIES HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY LATER HIGH RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPIC STUDIES. WE HAVE COMPLETED AN INITIAL LINE LIST FOR 32SL602  THOUGH THERE IS FURTHER REFINEMENT NEEDED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY AND EXTEND IT TO HIGHER J VALUES. FURTHER  ONCE A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE LINE LIST HAS BEEN  DETERMINED FOR 32SL602  THIS WILL BE EXTENDED TO ITS ISOTOPOLOGUES  INCLUDING 34SL602  32SL60L80  32SL802  34SL60L80  AND 34SL802. FURTHER  WE PROPOSE TO GO BEYOND WEEDING SPECTRA AND DEVELOP ROBUST STATE OF THE ART THEORETICAL SPECTROSCOPY METHODS TO GENERATE LIMITED LINE LISTS FOR SMALL TRANSIENT MOLECULES FOR WHICH THERE IS LITTLE OR NO EXPERIMENTAL DATA AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO AID ASTRONOMERS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE MANY AS YET UNASSIGNED LINES IN HIFI SPECTRA AND THAT WILL BE FOUND WITH THE GREAT AND EXES INSTRUMENTS ON SOFIA. LINE LISTS FOR THESE MOLECULES WILL BE LIMITED TO PURELY ROTATIONAL TRANSITIONS AS WELL AS THE ROVIBRATIONAL BANDS OF ALL FUNDAMENTALS. INITIALLY  WE WILL TARGET THE LIMITED LINE LIST STUDIES ON THE NH4  H2CL AND H20 MOLECULAR CATIONS.

WHEN MINERALS CRYSTALLIZE FROM MAGMAS LADEN WITH H20 COC02 N2 H2S ETC THE GASFLUIDPHASE COMPONENTS BECOME INCORPORATED  FORMING OXYANION COMPLEXES BEST KNOWN AMONG THEM OH HYDROXYL AND C032 CARBONATE. THERMODYNAMICALL SOLID STATE SOLUBILITY IS HIGHEST ATTHE CRYSTALLIZATION POINT BUT DECREASES WITH DECREASING TEMPERATURE. DURING COOLING THE EXSOLUTION BECOMES SO SLUGGISH THAT THE MINERALH20COCO0N2N2SH2S SOLID SOLUTION DRIFTS OUT OF THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM AND BECOMES SUPERSATURATED.

URANUS AND NEPTUNE  WITH MASSES LESS THAN 18 EARTH MASSES COMPRISE A DISTINCT CLASS FROM JUPITER AND SATURN  WITH MASSES GREATER THAN 95 EARTH MASSES. THE PRIMARY CONSTITUENTS OF URANUS AND NEPTUNE ARE LIKELY ICES SURROUNDING A ROCKY CORE WITH A RELATIVELY THIN ATMOSPHERIC VENEER OF HYDROGEN RICH GAS. THE KEPLER MISSION HAS ABLY DEMONSTRATED THAT SUCH NEPTUNE AND URANUS SIZED PLANETS ARE COMMON MUCH MORE COMMON THAN GAS GIANTS IN FACT OUTSIDE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. IT IS THUS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE INTERIOR STRUCTURE OF THESE WORLDS IN ORDER TO BETTER MODEL THEIR FORMATION AND EVOLUTION. UNFORTUNATELY OUR BEST DATA ON THE INTERIOR STRUCTURE OF THESE WORLDS COMES FROM THE GRAVITATIONAL HARMONICS MEASURED DURING THE SINGLE FLYBYS OF VOYAGER 2 ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO. OSCILLATIONS NOT ONLY PROVIDE COMPLIMENTARY INFORMATION BUT WOULD BE MORE SENSITIVE TO INTERNAL SHARP BOUNDARIES. THE TWO WHEEL K2 MISSION WILL NOW OBSERVE FIELDS ALONG THE ECLIPTIC CONTINUOUSLY UP TO 80 DAYS. K2 PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN ULTRA-HIGH PRECISION  HIGH DUTY-CYCLE  INTEGRATED DISC PHOTOMETRY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM S ICE GIANTS TO SEARCH FOR OSCILLATIONS. SEISMOLOGY IS BY FAR THE MOST PROMISING TECHNIQUE FOR CONSTRAINING THE CORE MASS OF A GIANT PLANET  INDEPENDENT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT PLAGUE INTERIOR MODEL INVERSION. ADDITIONAL GOALS INCLUDE LONG TERM (80 DAY) MONITORING OF WEATHER AND ROTATION MODULATION. RECORD OF GROUND AND BASED PHOTOMETRY HAVE SHOWN THAT ROTATIONAL VARIABILITY ON ICE GIANTS CAN COME FROM RATHER UNEXPECTED SOURCES. WE PLAN TO HAVE A LIMITED SET DISKRESOLVED IMAGES TO HELP CORRELATE OBSERVATIONS FROM K2 WITH ATMOSPHERIC ACTIVITY. K2 OBSERVATIONS OF NEPTUNE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN CLEAR 2% VARIATIONS ON TIME-SCALES RELATED TO THE ROTATION PERIOD. METHODOLOGY: OSCILLATIONS OF A GIANT PLANET CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE OBSERVABLE DISK  THUS ALTERING THE TOTAL REFLECTED SOLAR FLUX. FROM SIMPLE GEOMETRY ALONE A VELOCITY OF 50 CM/S WITH A FREQUENCY OF 1 MHZ CHANGES THE REFLECTED FLUX AT THE SEVERAL PPM LEVEL. THUS PHOTOMETRY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DETECT OSCILLATIONS EXCITED BY TURBULENCE FROM CONVECTION THAT PUMPS ENERGY INTO RANDOM SOUND WAVES. URANUS BRIGHTNESS AT QUADRATURE IS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE BRIGHTEST STARS THAT KEPLER HAS MONITORED IN ITS EXOPLANET SEARCH WITH AN APPARENT SIZE RANGING FROM 3.3 TO 4.0 . IT HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY SHOWN THAT KEPLER PHOTOMETRY FOR BRIGHT (V<8) STARS CAN REACH NOISE LEVELS OF BETTER THAN 1 PPM IN THE FOURIER DOMAIN ON TIME-SCALES SHORTER THAN 30 MINUTES WITH A MONTH OF OBSERVATIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF SEARCHES FOR GIANT PLANET OSCILLATIONS  PRIMARILY FOR JUPITER. GAULME ET AL. (2011) REPORTED THE DOPPLER DETECTION OF JOVIAN MODES WITH PEAK AMPLITUDES NEAR FREQUENCIES OF 1.2 MHZ  A PERIOD OF ABOUT 14 MINUTES. ONE OF US (MM) CARRIED OUT AN EXPLORATORY COMPUTATION OF ICE GIANT MODE FREQUENCIES SOME YEARS AGO BUT DID NOT PUBLISH THE RESULTS  BUT AS WITH JUPITER AND SATURN EXPECTED PERIODS ARE IN THE RANGE OF TENS TO HUNDREDS OF MINUTES. THUS SHORT-CADENCE IS NECESSARY. SUMMARY: OBSERVATIONS OF URANUS (AND OTHER GIANT PLANETS) WITH KEPLER HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ANSWER MANY LONG-STANDING QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INTERIOR STRUCTURE OF ICE GIANTS FROM DETECTING A CORE TO UNDERSTANDING THE COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE ENVELOPE. THE CLEAR DETECTION OF OSCILLATION MODES WILL OF COURSE ENERGIZE A NEW GENERATION OF THEORISTS TO COMPUTE MODEL FREQUENCIES FOR COMPARISON WITH DATA.

MARK MARLEY. THE PI FOR THIS PROPOSAL  DR. RICHARD FREEDMAN  IS A CO-I ON THESE PROPOSALS.  ABSTRACT FOR NNH11ZDA001N 11-OSS11-0134: THE NEXT FEW YEARS ARE EXPECTED TO WITNESS THE DISCOVERY OF A MULTITUDE OF YOUNG  WARM GIANT PLANETS BY SEVERAL DIRECT IMAGING GROUNDBASED SURVEYS. THESE DISCOVERIES WILL BE FOLLOWED UP BY HST AND JWST OBSERVATIONS OF THESE YOUNG WORLDS. WE PROPOSE TO CONSTRUCT THEORETICAL MODELS OF THE EVOLUTION AND THERMAL EMISSION SPECTRA OF YOUNG PLANETS OPTIMIZED TO MATCH THE PHOTOMETRIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC DATA THAT WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE. IN PARTICULAR WE WILL EXPLORE LARGER RANGES OF PARAMETER SPACE  INCLUDING COMPOSITION AND CLOUD PROPERTIES  THAN HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXPLORED TO STUDY YOUNG PLANETS. WE EXPECT THIS WORK WILL BE IMMEDIATELY USEFUL FOR INTERPRETING DATA FROM HST  SPHERE AND GPI AND WILL ALSO ULTIMATELY BE VALUABLE FOR UNDERSTANDING JWST DATA.  ABSTRACT FOR NH11ZDA001N 11-PATM11-0014: THE PAST HALF DECADE HAS BEEN THE ERA OF THE TRANSITING PLANETS. WE EXPECT THE NEXT HALF DOZEN YEARS WILL BE THE ERA OF THE DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS. UNLIKE THE CASE OF THE TRANSITING PLANETS  THE DETECTION OF YOUNG GAS AND ICE GIANTS DETECTED IN THERMAL EMISSION OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASUREMENT OF SPECTRA AND THUS OFFERS FAR MORE ROBUST OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDIES OF EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES. WE THUS PROPOSE A SUITE OF INVESTIGATIONS FOCUSING ON CLOUDS IN DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS. SPECIFICALLY WE WILL STUDY DISEQUILIBRIUM PROCESSES AFFECTING SILICATE CLOUDS  THE ROLE OF RELATIVELY MINOR CLOUDS IN SCULPTING SPECTRA AT LOW GRAVITY  THE ROLE OF WATER ICE CLOUDS  AND A GENERAL INVESTIGATION OF THE SPECTRA OF A GREAT VARIETY OF PLANETS WITH VARYING ATMOSPHERIC METALLICITY AND C/O RATIO. THIS WORK WILL SUPPORT INTERPRETATION OF THE ALREADY KNOWN DIRECTLY IMAGED PLANETS AND--MORE IMPORTANTLY--THE WEALTH OF DATA WE EXPECT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE WILL COMPARE OUR MODEL PREDICTIONS TO DATA IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND RELATE THEM TO THOSE PROCESSES ACTING IN SOLAR SYSTEM ATMOSPHERES,NON,12,B,2,,2017-02-21 00:00:00

THE PROCESSES OF PHYSICS AND THE PROPERTIES OF METEORITES SPEAK IN TWO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES  BUT WE NEED BOTH TO UNDERSTAND THE EARLIEST STAGES OF PLANET FORMATION.

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF THESE LAYERED OUTCROPS AND TEST WHETHER SEDIMENTARY PROCESSES MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR FORMATION. INVESTIGATION SUMMARY: WE WILL INVESTIGATE AND DOCUMENT A NUMBER OF PARAMETERS INCLUDING BEDDING BRIGHTNESS  BEDDING THICKNESS  STRIKE AND DIP  LARGE-SCALE TEXTURE (E.G. POLYGONS)  AND MINERALOGY FOR MULTIPLE LAYERED OUTCROPS THROUGHOUT THE MAWRTH VALLIS REGION AND EVALUATE THESE PROPERTIES IN RELATION TO THE GEOLOGIC CONTEXT OF THE LAYERED OUTCROPS AND THEIR PROXIMITY TO OYAMA CRATER AND THE CHANNEL. PROPOSED FORMATION PROCESSES FOR THESE LAYERED MATERIALS INCLUDE A SEDIMENTARY ORIGIN  DIAGENESIS  IMPACT-RELATED MECHANISMS  ALTERATION OF VOLCANIC ASH  PYROCLASTIC ACTIVITY AND OTHERS. WE SEEK TO DETERMINE THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES AMONG THE PHYLLOSILICATE AND SULFATE-BEARING STRATA AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE UNITS OF THESE OUTCROPS. WE PROPOSE TO PREPARE AND ANALYZE 8 HIRISE DTMS AND 30 CRISM IMAGES FOR THIS PROJECT. THIS STUDY WILL COMPARE THE PROPERTIES OF LAYERED OUTCROPS AT MAWRTH VALLIS WITH THOSE OF ACCEPTED MARTIAN SEDIMENTS AND ANCIENT TERRESTRIAL SEDIMENTS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF SEDIMENTARY PROCESSES CONTRIBUTED TO FORMATION OF LAYERED OUTCROPS IN SOME AREAS OF MAWRTH VALLIS. SIGNIFICANCE: DETERMINING THE ORIGIN OF THE EXPANSIVE LAYERED OUTCROPS AT MAWRTH VALLIS WOULD PROVIDE CLUES TO THE EARLY AQUEOUS PROCESSES ON MARS. THE PROPOSED FORMATION MECHANISMS RELY ON DIFFERENT GEOCHEMICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL CONDITIONS; THUS  CONSTRAINING THESE WILL INFORM THE EARLY MARTIAN ENVIRONMENT.

STO-2 WILL ADDRESS A KEY PROBLEM IN MODERN ASTROPHYSICS  UNDERSTANDING THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM (ISM). STO-2 WILL SURVEY APPROXIMATELY   OF THE SOUTHERN GALACTIC PLANE IN THE DOMINANT INTERSTELLAR COOLING LINE [CII] (158  M) AND THE IMPORTANT STAR FORMATION TRACER [NII] (205  M). WITH ~1 ARCMINUTE ANGULAR RESOLUTION  STO-2 WILL SPATIALLY RESOLVE ATOMIC  IONIC AND MOLECULAR CLOUDS OUT TO 10 KPC. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ITS ENHANCED  EXTENDED LIFETIME CRYOGENIC RECEIVERS  THE STO-2 SURVEY WILL BE CONDUCTED AT UNPARALLELED SENSITIVITY LEVELS. STO-2 WILL UNIQUELY PROBE THE PIVOTAL FORMATIVE AND DISRUPTIVE STAGES IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GLOBAL STAR FORMATION RATES AND THE PROPERTIES OF THE ISM. COMBINED WITH PREVIOUS HI AND CO SURVEYS  STO-2 WILL CREATE 3-DIMENSIONAL MAPS OF THE STRUCTURE  DYNAMICS  TURBULENCE  ENERGY BALANCE  AND PRESSURE OF THE MILKY WAY'S ISM  AS WELL AS THE STAR FORMATION RATE. ONCE WE GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISM PROPERTIES AND STAR FORMATION IN THE MILKY WAY  WE CAN BETTER INTERPRET OBSERVATIONS OF NEARBY GALAXIES AND THE DISTANT UNIVERSE. THE MISSION GOALS FOR THESE SURVEYS ARE TO:  *DETERMINE THE LIFE CYCLE OF GALACTIC INTERSTELLAR GAS. *STUDY THE CREATION AND DISRUPTION OF STAR-FORMING CLOUDS IN THE GALAXY. *DETERMINE THE PARAMETERS THAT AFFECT THE STAR FORMATION RATE IN THE GALAXY. * PROVIDE TEMPLATES FOR STAR FORMATION AND STELLAR/INTERSTELLAR FEEDBACK IN OTHER GALAXIES.  STO-2 WILL RE-USE THE 80CM TELESCOPE  GONDOLA  AND SUBSYSTEMS FROM STO-1. FOR THE STO-2 FLIGHT  STO-1'S HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION (<1 KM/S) HETERODYNE RECEIVER SYSTEM WILL BE UPGRADED FOR EXTENDED CRYOGENIC LIFETIME  ENHANCED SENSITIVITY  AND GREATER RELIABILITY. THE FLIGHT RECEIVER HAS EIGHT  CRYOGENIC HEB MIXERS; FOUR OPTIMIZED FOR THE [CII] LINE AND FOUR FOR THE [NII] LINE. STO-2 WILL ALSO FLY AN UNCOOLED  SCHOTTKY RECEIVER TO OBSERVE THE 609  M [CI] LINE AT 3 ARCMINUTE RESOLUTION. THE INSTRUMENT SPECTROMETER HAS SUFFICIENT BANDWIDTH TO DETECT ALL CLOUDS PARTICIPATING IN GALACTIC ROTATION IN EACH OF ITS 9 PIXELS. STO IS CAPABLE OF DETECTING EVERY GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUD  EVERY HII REGION OF SIGNIFICANCE  AND EVERY DIFFUSE HI CLOUD WITH (AV # 0.4) WITHIN ITS SURVEY REGION.  THE STO-1 LAUNCH WAS ON 15 JANUARY 2012. BEFORE ACHIEVING FLOAT ALTITUDE A FROZEN ABSOLUTE PRESSURE REGULATOR VENTED APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE LIQUID HELIUM SUPPLY TO THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS EVENT REDUCED THE CRYOGENIC (THZ) PORTION OF THE MISSION TO ~5 DAYS. THE EFFICACY OF THE OBSERVATIONS CONDUCTED DURING THIS PERIOD WAS HINDERED BY SEVERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES EXPERIENCED EARLY IN THE FLIGHT. THE CAUSES OF THESE ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED AND CORRECTED IN FLIGHT. STO THEN TRANSITIONED INTO ITS `WARM MISSION SCIENCE PROGRAM AND CONTINUED OBSERVATIONS USING AN UNCOOLED 492 GHZ [CI] RECEIVER UNTIL THE END OF ITS FLIGHT ON 29 JANUARY 2012. HERE WE PROPOSE TO RE-FLY STO WITH AN UPGRADED  MORE ROBUST CRYOGENIC/RECEIVER SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW THZ OBSERVATIONS TO CONTINUE UNTIL STRATOSPHERIC CONDITIONS OR RECOVERY CONSTRAINTS REQUIRE TERMINATING THE MISSION (UP TO ~60 DAYS). STO-2 WILL BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY FROM THE HERITAGE AND EXPERIENCE GAINED DURING THE STO-1 CAMPAIGN.",NON,12,B,2,,2017-04-20 00:00:00

THESE ARE THE BEST TRACERS OF THE REMOTE HALO  FOR AT THEIR HIGH LUMINOSITIES THEY REMAIN VISIBLE TO 100 KPC  AND THEIR PRESENCE IN POPULATIONS OF ALL METALLICITIES AND AGES ENSURES AN UNBIASED SAMPLE OF THE STELLAR POPULATION. THE PRIMARY DIFFICULTY IN THEIR IDENTIFICATION IS DISTINGUISHING THEM FROM FOREGROUND DWARFS  WHICH FORM THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF STARS AT THESE MAGNITUDES AND COLORS. ROUGHLY 300 GIANTS AT DISTANCES>50 KPC SPREAD OVER THE SKY HAVE NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM SDSS SEGUE SPECTRA  BUT WITH A BIAS TOWARDS LOW METALLICITIES AND HOTTER GIANTS  INTRODUCED BY THE SELECTION CRITERIA FOR TARGETING STARS FOR SEGUE SPECTRAL OBSERVATIONS TO INCREASE THE GIANT YIELD. METHODSHERE WE PROPOSE TO IDENTIFY THE REDDER  COOLER  MORE LUMINOUS GIANTS  WHERE THE U-G VS. G-R DIAGRAM PROVIDES SOME GIANT-DWARF DISCRIMINATION. WE PROPOSE K2 LONG-CADENCE LIGHT CURVES FOR SIX HUNDRED POTENTIAL LUMINOUS RED GIANTS WITH 0.9<= (G-R)O<= 1.3  TO IDENTIFY SUCH GIANTS BY DETECTING AND MEASURING NU_MAX  THE PEAK IN THE POWER SPECTRUM DUE TO SOLAR-LIKE (P-MODE) OSCILLATIONS. IN THESE COOL  LUMINOUS STARS SUCH PEAKS ARE DETECTABLE EVEN AT FAINT MAGNITUDES USING LONG-CADENCE DATA. IN CONTRAST  THE POWER-SPECTRUM PEAKS OF THE INTERVENING DWARFS WILL NOT BE DETECTED AT ALL  DUE TO THEIR HIGHER FREQUENCIES AND LOWER AMPLITUDES. AS STANDARDS WE ADD SIXTY STARS WITH 0.7<= (G-R)O<= 1.2 ALREADY IDENTIFIED AS GIANTS. IN ADDITION TO THE (G-R)O LIMITS  WHICH RESTRICT THEIR TEMPERATURES TO COOLER THAN 4600K  OUR SIX HUNDRED POTENTIAL RED GIANTS ON-SILICON IN THE C8 AND C10 FIELDS MEET SEVERAL ADDITIONAL CRITERIA. CHIEF AMONG THEM IS A CUTOFF IN THE SDSS U-G VS. G-R COLOR-COLOR DIAGRAM  WHERE DWARFS AND GIANTS DIVERGE. THIS PROMISES A YIELD WELL ABOVE THE 3% ACHIEVED BY SEGUE  AND HAS A REDUCED BIAS TOWARDS LOW METALLICITY. THE TARGETS MEETING THESE CRITERIA HAVE 16.2<= KP<18.5. FOLLOW-UP SPECTROSCOPY IS FEASIBLE WITH MULTI-OBJECT SPECTROGRAPHS IN BOTH HEMISPHERES  BUT IS NOT NEEDED TO DETERMINE TEMPERATURES  NOR FOR A FIRST ESTIMATE OF METALLICITY. BY COMPARING THE UGRI COLORS OF CASTELLI&KURUCZ (2003) MODEL ATMOSPHERES TO THE OBSERVED SDSS PHOTOMETRY OF STARS KNOWN TO BE GIANTS  WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF A RED GIANT IN A HALO FIELD OF LOW REDDENING SUCH AS C8 AND C10 IS DETERMINED TO 100K FROM ITS G-R COLOR ALONE. BECAUSE NU_MAX IS SENSITIVE PRIMARILY TO STELLAR SURFACE GRAVITY  ITS VALUE AS DETERMINED FROM K2 POWER SPECTRA  COUPLED WITH TEFF FROM G-R  SETS THE LUMINOSITY OF THE GIANT. BECAUSE GIANT LUMINOSITY AT A GIVEN G-R IS A FUNCTION OF STELLAR METALLICITY  THIS PROVIDES A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF [FE/H] FOR EACH DETECTED GIANT. RELEVANCE TO THE K2 SOLICITATION AND NEED FOR NEW K2 OBSERVATIONS  KEPLER 2 IS THE ONLY MEANS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE THAT IS CAPABLE OF DISTINGUISHING RED GIANTS FROM DWARFS FOR HUNDREDS OF STARS SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER A WIDE FIELD. THE LARGE FIELD IS NECESSARY BECAUSE COOL RED GIANTS ARE VERY RARE  AS NOTED ABOVE. ALTHOUGH THE KEPLER FIELD HAS PRODUCED MANY METAL-POOR GIANTS  THESE ARE NOT IN THE REMOTE HALO BECAUSE MOST ARE BRIGHTER THAN OUR MAGNITUDE LIMIT AND BECAUSE THE LINE OF SIGHT OF THE KEPLER FIELD SKIMS THE GALACTIC PLANE AND DOES NOT REACH FAR INTO THE HALO. PREVIOUS K2 HALO FIELDS INCLUDE VERY FEW SUCH FAINT STARS WITH UGRI PHOTOMETRY THAT INDICATES A POTENTIAL COOL GIANT. CONSEQUENTLY  THIS PROPOSED WORK IS RESPONSIVE TO THE K2 SOLICITATION FOR THE HALO FIELDS C8 AND C10.,NON,M,A,2,,2017-12-05 21:06:17.112296

DESPITE THE LIMITED SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THESE DATA  DETAILED ANALYSIS HAS REVEALED THAT EACH BAND IS  IN FACT  A BLEND OF MULTIPLE EMISSION FEATURES. SUBTLE VARIATIONS IN THE BAND BLENDING CAN BE DETECTED EVEN FOR SPECTRA MEASURED AT DIFFERENT POSITIONS WITHIN A SINGLE ASTRONOMICAL SOURCE. THESE VARIATIONS CAN BE SEEN TO ARISE FROM MULTIPLE PAH AND PAH RELATED CARRIERS THAT ARE EACH RESPONDING DIFFERENTLY TO THE LOCAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE HAS NEAR IR AND MID IR INSTRUMENTS  NIRSPEC AND MIRI  WITH AN EXTREMELY HIGH SPECTRAL RESOLUTION  SPATIAL RESOLUTION  AND SENSITIVITY THAT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE INFRARED ASTRONOMY. THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL PROVIDE SPATIAL MAPS ON A SUB ARCSECOND SCALE WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF SPECTRAL DETAIL  ALLOWING DETAILED STUDY OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS WITHIN EACH EMISSION BAND. THIS WILL PROVIDE A CRITICAL INSIGHT INTO THE MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EMITTING SPECIES AND THEIR  PHOTOCHEMICAL EVOLUTION IN SPACE.EXPLOITATION OF THESE ASTRONOMICAL SPECTRA REQUIRES FUNDAMENTAL DATA ON POTENTIAL EMITTING SPECIES THAT FULLY ACCOUNT FOR ALL ASTROPHYSICALLY RELEVANT MATERIALS. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES  SPECTRA OF NEUTRAL AND CHARGED PAHS HAVE BEEN CALCULATED USING QUANTUM THEORY. DUE TO COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS  THIS DATA SET IS BIASED TOWARDS SMALLER OR HIGHLY SYMMETRIC SPECIES. IN ADDITION  CONTINUED ANALYSIS OF THE MID IR EMISSION BANDS BY SEVERAL RECENT SPITZER STUDIES  HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT PAHS AND PAH CLUSTERSWITH LESS SYMMETRIC STRUCTURES CONTAINING BAY REGIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE IR EMISSION BANDS THAN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN REALIZED. THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFRARED DATA SET ON LESS SYMMETRIC PAHS AND PAH CLUSTERS IS INSUFFICIENT TO EXPLOIT THE ASTRONOMICAL DATA.ADVANCES IN COMPUTING POWER NOW ALLOW SPECTRA FOR A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF SPECIES TO BE CALCULATED.

THIS WORK WILL ACCOUNT FOR IMPORTANT PHYSICAL PROCESSES HERETOFORE NEGLECTED AND THEREBY PROVIDE A MUCH MORE REALISTIC MODEL FOR THE FORMATION AND EARLY EVOLUTION OF THE GIANT PLANETS. DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF GIANT PLANET ACCRETION  WITH A ROCKY CORE OF AROUND AN EARTH MASS  THE BASAL TEMPERATURE OF THE HYDROGEN ATMOSPHERE ABOVE THIS GROWING CORE CAN ALREADY EXCEED A FEW THOUSAND DEGREES  SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW EVAPORATION OF ACCRETED PLANETESIMALS WITHIN THE ENVELOPE. THIS MAY AFFECT THE GROWTH OF THE GIANT PLANET  PRIMARILY BY INCREASING THE MEAN MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF THE ENVELOPE (REDUCING THE PRESSURE SCALE HEIGHT)  AND IT MAY ALSO PRODUCE A WIDER RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FOR GIANT PLANET FORMATION THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY STUDIED. THE CONSEQUENCES MAY BE PARTIALLY PRESERVED THROUGHOUT SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION AND INFLUENCE THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE GIANT PLANETS TODAY.

MAJOR ADVANCES IN EXOPLANET DETECTION PLACE HUMANITY ON THE BRINK OF FINALLY ANSWERING ASTROBIOLOGYS OVERARCHING QUESTION ARE WE ALONE BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY SCIENTIFIC STEPS REQUIRED BEFORE WE CAN IDENTIFY A LIVING WORLD BEYOND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM. THE NASA KEPLER MISSION SHOWS US THAT TERRESTRIAL PLANETS ARE COMMON  BUT HOW DO WE RECOGNIZE A HABITABLE ONE.  ON THE HORIZON  THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE JWST MAY PROVIDE THE FIRST EVER PEEK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF A HABITABLE PLANET  BUT WILL LIKELY ONLY HAVE TIME TO STUDY ONE SUCH WORLD. WHEN OBSERVATIONS ARE CHALLENGING AND RESOURCES ARE SCARCE  WHICH PLANETS SHOULD WE SPEND TIME STUDYING. LONGER TERM MISSIONS  SUCH AS THE TERRESTRIAL PLANET FINDER TPF  MAY RETURN SPECTRA FROM A DIVERSITY OF WORLDS. WHAT SHOULD WE DESIGN TPF TO LOOK FOR  AND HOW DO WE RECOGNIZE SIGNS OF HABITABILITY AND LIFE FOR WORLDS WITH DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS  ORBITING STARS UNLIKE OUR OWN. THE VIRTUAL PLANETARY LABORATORY WILL SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE SCIENCE RETURN FROM NASA MISSIONS THAT DETECT AND CHARACTERIZE EXTRASOLAR TERRESTRIAL PLANETS. THE VPL INTEGRATES COMPUTER MODELING  LABORATORY AND FIELDWORK ACROSS A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF PLANETARY HABITABILITY AND BIO SIGNATURES. WE WILL USE ENVIRONMENTAL MODELS TO FURTHER CHARACTERIZE NEWLY DISCOVERED PLANETS FOR WHICH FOLLOW UP OBSERVATIONS ARE CHALLENGING OR NON EXISTENT  DEVELOP THE SCIENTIFIC FRAMEWORK TO PRIORITIZE TARGETS FOR FURTHER STUDY BY UPCOMING MISSIONS  DETERMINE THE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES REQUIRED FOR REMOTE SENSING DETECTION OF HABITABILITY AND LIFE FOR A RANGE OF CURRENT AND PROPOSED SPACE BASED OBSERVATORIES  AND DEVELOP OPTIMAL RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES TO OBTAIN PLANETARY PROPERTIES FROM EXOPLANETARY SPECTRA. THE UNIFYING INTELLECTUAL FOCUS OF THE VIRTUAL PLANETARY LABORATORY IS TO LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE WHETHER AN EXTRASOLAR PLANET CAN OR DOES SUPPORT LIFE. ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WORK TOWARDS THAT SPECIFIC GOAL. TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL  WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE TEAM AND MODELING TOOLBOX REQUIRED TO ANALYZE PLANETARY HABITABILITY AS A MULTI DIMENSIONAL  INTERDISCIPLINARY PARAMETER SPACE. WE WILL USE THIS IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE OF PLANETARY HABITABILITY TO DETERMINE THE PLANETARY CHARACTERISTICS  AND THE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES REQUIRED TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN PLANETS WITH AND WITHOUT LIFE. THIS RESEARCH SUPPORTS NASA ASTROBIOLOGY ROADMAP GOALS 1  4  5 AND 7. THE VPL WILL EXPLORE THE EVOLUTION AND LIMITS OF TERRESTRIAL PLANET HABITABILITY VIA A PLANETS INTERACTION WITH ITS PARENT STAR AND PLANETARY SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT  AND IDENTIFY LIFES OBSERVABLE IMPACT ON A PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT FOR DIFFERENT METABOLISMS  PLANETARY COMPOSITIONS  AND HOST STARS. TO DO THIS  WE WILL DEVELOP  REFINE AND COMBINE 1D AND 3D CLIMATE  PHOTOCHEMICAL  RADIATIVE TRANSFER  ATMOSPHERIC ESCAPE  PLANETARY INTERIOR  BIOGEOCHEMICAL  BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY  VEGETATION  ORBITAL EVOLUTION AND PLANET FORMATION MODELS. AS INPUT TO THESE MODELS WE WILL OBTAIN LABORATORY  FIELD AND OBSERVATIONAL DATA FROM THE STELLAR  PLANETARY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES. THE COMBINATION OF DATA AND MODELS WILL BE USED TO DERIVE A COMPREHENSIVE  INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTERIZATION OF A GIVEN PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT AND ITS LIKELY HISTORY. WE WILL USE THESE RESULTS TO RECOGNIZE HABITABLE WORLDS AND TO DISCRIMINATE 2 BETWEEN THE SPECTRA OF PLANETS WITH AND WITHOUT LIFE  BY UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNATURES OF LIFE IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES  WE PROPOSE 5 INTERDISCIPLINARY AND STRONGLY INTERRELATED TASKS.  THE FIRST FOUR TASKS PROVIDE A SUITE OF SELF CONSISTENT PLANETARY ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROGRESS FROM BEING PREDOMINANTLY DATA TO MODEL CONSTRAINED.
